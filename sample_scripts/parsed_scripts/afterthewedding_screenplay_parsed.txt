M: After the Wedding
M: Screenplay by
M: Bart Freundlich
M: Based on the film directed by Susanne Bier
M: Written by Anders Thomas Jensen and Suzanne Bier
M: 1 EXT. CALCUTTA INDIA. FROM ABOVE - MORNING 1
M: We soar above the busy, dilapidated city, towards the
M: outskirts of town, where we close in on the remnants of
M: what looks like an ancient, abandoned temple.
M: 2 INT./EXT. DILAPIDATED TEMPLE, OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY 2
M: ISABEL (39), leads a meditation. She’s not native to this
M: part of the world, though her skin is deeply tanned and
M: her hair is streaked from the sun.
M: Her eyes are closed and she emits a subtle chanting
M: sound. Her lids flutter and her eyes open and look right
M: at us.
M: WHAT SHE SEES:
M: Sitting facing her, are a dozen Indian children
M: attempting to meditate. One lies on his back looking up
M: at his hands, pretending they are a bird, flying over
M: head. Isabel stands and walks to him.
M: She kneels next to him and looks at his bird-hands. After
M: a moment, she lies next to him. She whispers in
M: ‘Bengali’.
M: ISABEL
M: (In Bengali)
M: What kind of bird is that?
M: The 7 year old boy, JAI, looks at her and shrugs his
M: shoulders. Isabel puts her hands up in the air and makes
M: a bird of her own. They fly together.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: (Bengali)
M: Why don’t you sit up and meditate with
M: the others and you can imagine as many
M: birds as you like.
M: JAI
M: (Bengali)
M: I don’t want to close my eyes today.
M: Isabel examines his precious face.
M: ISABEL
M: OK. But help me with the bell.
M: Jai smiles and excitedly scampers to his feet. He puts
M: his hands out to help Isabel up.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 2.
M: Jai goes to the front of the room and grabs a bell. He
M: looks to Isabel in anticipation, and she nods.
M: With all his might, he shakes the bell and a low ring
M: emanates, signaling the meditation is over.
M: The others open their eyes. Jai laughs at their surprised
M: expressions as they see it’s him with the bell.
M: 3 EXT. DILAPIDATED TEMPLE - DAY 3
M: Like the pied piper, Isabel leads the children out of the
M: beautiful but broken down temple, back into the rundown
M: village streets.
M: TITLE: AFTER THE WEDDING
M: 4 EXT. CALCUTTA STREET, IMPOVERISHED AREA - LATER THAT DAY 4
M: Isabel, Jai, and a few other children from the orphanage,
M: ride in the back of an open pick up truck down a dusty
M: street.
M: A group of hungry local children chase the truck as it
M: pulls up in an open square and stops.
M: The driver gets out and the local kids surround the
M: truck. Isabel and the orphans begin their routine of
M: serving a meal from giant pots; rice and lentils. The
M: hungry children wait with cups and get food ladled in.
M: 5 INT. BACK OF TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON 5
M: The exhausted group rides back toward the orphanage. The
M: sun has just set and the sky is a silvery blue. Jai is
M: glued to Isabel’s side as they all sing a song.
M: 6 INT./ EXT. ORPHANAGE - EVENING 6
M: Isabel’s truck pull in.
M: A French aid worker, JAQUES (Late 40’s), is laying out
M: some supplies he has brought in a van. Isabel’s truck
M: pulls in and she hops out, anxiously.
M: ISABEL
M: (to Jaques)
M: What did you get?
M: She blows by him to check out the supplies.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 3.
M: JAQUES
M: (sarcastically)
M: It’s nice to see you...
M: Isabel looks through what he’s brought. She picks up some
M: sheets.
M: ISABEL
M: Where are the beds? The food? And there
M: were supposed to be school supplies.
M: JAQUES
M: We can hang hammocks. Temporarily.
M: A beat as they look at each other.
M: JAQUES (CONT'D)
M: It’s all I could get. For the money.
M: She looks at him slightly confused, then shakes her head
M: and marches away.
M: 7 INT. ORPHANAGE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 7
M: Isabel marches in.
M: ISABEL
M: Where’s the money we were promised? How
M: long are we supposed to wait?
M: The director of the orphanage, PREENA (60’s), sits at her
M: desk, going over some paperwork. She removes her glasses
M: and takes a deep breath.
M: PREENA
M: They want you to go meet with them.
M: ISABEL
M: What?
M: PREENA
M: In New York. To tell them why we are a
M: worthy cause.
M: Isabel is taken aback.
M: ISABEL
M: How many hoops are we supposed to jump
M: through?
M: Preena watches her.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 4.
M: PREENA
M: Their money, their terms.
M: This infuriates Isabel.
M: ISABEL
M: Well, I’m not going to go teach
M: compassion when the kids need me here.
M: Tell them to go save the fucking whales.
M: Isabel heads out the door.
M: PREENA
M: They want to give us 2 million dollars.
M: Isabel is stopped by the number. She and Preena look at
M: each other.

M: (MORE)
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 6.

M: down onto the sprawling yard, where we see the beginnings
M: of a party set up. Theresa takes a breath then:
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: (yelling)
M: Chickens! I’m home!
M: 18 INT. TWIN BOY’S ROOM - EVENING 18
M: Theresa walks in to find her 8 year old twin boys, OTTO

M: THERESA
M: What’s going on here?
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 7.
M: TWINS
M: (distracted by the game)
M: Hi mom.
M: Theresa looks at the screen as the boys’ avatars fight
M: each other.
M: THERESA
M: You know I don’t like this game.
M: They groan a little.
M: TWINS
M: Dad said we could.
M: THERESA
M: Well, now mom’s home.
M: MINUTES LATER
M: All three sit together on the floor, the boys on either
M: side of Theresa as she reads them a book. “Meet my
M: staff”. She does all the voices. They lean on her.

M: A sculpture exhibit is being installed. OSCAR CARLSON,
M: (early 40’s), somewhere between artist and construction
M: worker, meticulously measures, hoists, and tinkers with
M: the lighting. Some movers and gallery staff stand by to
M: help.
M: He climbs down off the ladder and approaches a tower
M: looking sculpture made of balanced rocks. He watches how
M: the lights that now slowly rotate above illuminate the
M: rock structure.
M: He takes a step back and looks. Everyone waits.
M: OSCAR
M: It’s catching at about 12 O’clock
M: He looks at the beams above where the lights hang.
M: OSCAR (CONT’D)
M: We may need to re-rig so the power cord
M: can run vertically.
M: The workers take a deep breath. Oscar takes a further
M: step back and we see now there is a translucent patterned
M: curtain with a hole in it through which the audience is
M: meant to view the sculpture through. As he looks:
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 8.

M: dressed for a night out. Oscar is happy to hear from her.
M: OSCAR
M: What’s going on?
M: GRACE
M: Nothing. Just getting married this
M: weekend.
M: OSCAR
M: Yeah, not that big a deal.
M: She hangs on the line. Looks behind her to a whole group
M: of friends all drinking and eating together. They are
M: rowdy and making a ton of noise. JONATHAN (26),
M: attractive in a conservative way, beckons her back over.
M: JONATHAN
M: C’mon Grace! Milly bought us a round of
M: shots.
M: OSCAR
M: Sounds like fun over there.
M: GRACE
M: Kind of...
M: She’s clearly not into it. Oscar can read her.
M: OSCAR
M: (comforting)
M: It’s going to be perfect. Mom has
M: everyone working at maximum efficiency.
M: He laughs and Grace smiles warmly. A quiet moment. The
M: group beckons Grace again.

M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 9.

M: OSCAR
M: What’s wrong with the boys? Why are they
M: reading?
M: THERESA
M: (takes off her glasses)
M: Did you tell them they could play mortal
M: killing?
M: OSCAR
M: Mortal Combat. I may have.
M: He gives her a face. She rolls her eyes. He sits on the
M: edge of the tub and leans in for a kiss.
M: THERESA
M: (re: show)
M: So, how does it look?
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 10.
M: OSCAR
M: Never quite like I imagine.
M: She’s used to hearing this.
M: THERESA
M: (The work is beautiful), It’s going to be
M: great. Just try to relax and enjoy it.
M: He smiles at her and takes her foot out of the tub. He
M: rubs it.
M: OSCAR
M: Gracie, called. I think she wanted some
M: reassurance. She sounded nervous.
M: THERESA
M: I guess it runs in the family.
M: He smiles.
M: OSCAR
M: Are you nervous?
M: THERESA
M: Are you nervous?
M: OSCAR
M: Excuse me for a minute, I have to take
M: this...
M: He takes her foot and uses it like a telephone.
M: OSCAR (CONT’D)
M: Hello... sorry, she’s too nervous to
M: talk.
M: She laughs and tries to pull her foot away.
M: THERESA
M: That tickles... Seriously.
M: She starts to laugh and struggle. He holds it tighter and
M: bites up her leg.
M: She grabs his hands to stop him. He lets himself slide
M: into the tub, all his clothes on. She is shocked and lets
M: out a scream of surprise. He pulls her close and they
M: kiss passionately.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 11.
M: 24 INT. ISABEL’S BEDROOM, INDIA - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 24

M: Jai who looks at Isabel guiltily, then down to his
M: tattered shorts which are wet in the front. Some of the
M: other children sit up and look.
M: Isabel goes to him. She sees the mattress is soaked
M: through.
M: ISABEL
M: Jai, it’s okay...
M: She tries to calm him, then turns to Jaques.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)

M: Jaques nods.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: (strongly)
M: Do you hear me?
M: JAQUES
M: I do...
M: Jaques thinks.
M: JAQUES (CONT’D)
M: Why don’t I go New York and meet with
M: them? You can fill me in and I’ll take

M: Yes. I understand. Of course.
M: She hangs up and looks at Isabel.
M: PREENA (CONT’D)
M: It has to be you.
M: Isabel gets agitated.
M: ISABEL
M: Why? That’s ridiculous.

M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 13.
M: THERESA
M: (into phone)
M: What’s their response to the truncated
M: retention period?
M: She listens.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: That’s not going to work. We can give on
M: the deferred compensation, but the
M: retention period is non-negotiable.
M: She listens. Wider. We see the beauty of the path.
M: Bill lays out the terms he’ll go back with. Theresa slows
M: as she sees something up ahead. A massive tree that has
M: fallen in last nights storm, split at the base of its
M: trunk.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: OK, I’m on my walk. I’m going to call you
M: back from the car.
M: She hangs up and approaches the tree which blocks the
M: path.
M: AT THE TREE: Theresa is dwarfed by it. She examines it,
M: walking down the length until she gets to where it split.
M: It’s a violent but beautiful sight; Splintered wood,
M: roots with moss still attached pointing up to the sky,
M: tree sap hanging on the points of the razor sharp breaks
M: in the wood.
M: She touches it in fascination. A little sap on her
M: fingers. She lets them stick together.
M: Then, just over to the side, she spots something else. A
M: birds nest on the ground.
M: Theresa goes over to it and bends close. She clears away
M: some leaves to see the carefully made nest has shards of
M: broken blue eggs in it. She touches one gently, then
M: looks up in the sky.
M: A bird circles above.
M: A29 A PLANE CUTS THROUGH THE SKY A29
M: 29 INT. AIR INDIA, FIRST CLASS - DAY 29
M: Isabel sits uncomfortably amongst mainly business people.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 14.

M: Isabel hugs Preena.
M: ISABEL
M: (to Preena)
M: Check on him. Every night.
M: PREENA
M: We were here long before God brought you
M: to us Isabel.
M: Isabel takes a deep breath.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 15.
M: ISABEL
M: I’m coming back with a suit case full of
M: money.
M: 33 INT. JFK AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CLAIM 33
M: Isabel exits with the throngs of people. Gets to the

M: approaches. He takes her bag from her and leads the way.

M: run next to it, yelling their good-byes. She waves.
M: 35 INT. TESLA/ EXT. NEW YORK CITY 35

M: publication. Isabel picks up “The New York Post”. Some
M: horrific political scandal on the back. She puts it down
M: and picks up “The Wall Street Journal: “Market Bullish
M: over tax plan”. Not her world. She rolls down her window.
M: From the “Kosciusko” Bridge. Manhattan in all it’s glory
M: off to the west.
M: 36 EXT. BOWERY HOTEL - DAY 36
M: The car pulls up in front of this chic Bowery Hotel.

M: kitchen.
M: The place is stunning and fancy. The manager walks to the
M: fireplace.
M: MANAGER (CONT’D)
M: These are gas and operated with a switch.
M: She ignites one then continues the tour.
M: MANAGER (CONT’D)
M: Fully stocked refrigerator and kitchen.
M: She opens the doors to the fridge: it is packed.
M: MANAGER (CONT’D)
M: We couldn’t get an answer on what you
M: liked, so we had to do some guess work.
M: Anything that is missing, please let us
M: know.
M: Isabel is looking out the window at the city scape, only
M: hearing half of what the manager has said.
M: MANAGER (CONT’D)
M: The shades are all controlled by remote
M: control, from this ipad, here.
M: The manager hands her a cell phone.
M: MANAGER (CONT'D)
M: This is your cell phone. There is a car
M: at your disposal. My number and the
M: drivers are both programmed.
M: The manager smiles.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 17.
M: MANAGER (CONT’D)
M: I’ll let you get your bearings. And,
M: Welcome.
M: The Manager heads out. Isabel is left alone.
M: She takes a deep breath, then walks over to the

M: of food and drink. She shakes her head at the excess.
M: 40 INT./EXT. OSCAR’S STUDIO - ON PROPERTY - DAY 40
M: A large shed like building with a little courtyard. We
M: can see the house in the background.
M: The courtyard and the studio are filled with sculptures
M: and tools. Some are large. Some made of wood, some stone.
M: There is also a kiln in the corner with blocks of clay
M: and pots in various stages of being glazed.
M: Oscar stains a wood piece, that stands about as tall as
M: him. We can’t quite see it in it’s entirety. His phone
M: rings: “Theresa”.
M: 41 INT. OUTSIDE HORIZON CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME 41
M: Theresa has stepped out of a meeting to call Oscar.
M: 42 INT. OSCAR’S STUDIO/ INT. OUTSIDE HORIZON CONFERENCE ROOM 42
M: THERESA
M: I think I forgot to tell the caterer no
M: sesame or nuts.
M: OSCAR
M: I did it.
M: THERESA
M: Thank god. And I’m worried about the
M: lobster risotto. I think I pressured her
M: into it.
M: OSCAR
M: She needs to have something to resent us
M: about. Let it be the lobster risotto.
M: Oscar breathes a sigh of relief.
M: OSCAR (CONT’D)
M: Also, I got a call from the fire
M: Marshall.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 18.

M: Silence.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Oscar?
M: OSCAR
M: I’m kidding, I did it.
M: He jots down “car for parents”.
M: THERESA
M: Ok. I gotta get back to work.
M: OSCAR
M: Wait.
M: THERESA
M: What?
M: OSCAR
M: Why is this happening?
M: THERESA
M: Cause it’s what she wants, baby.
M: OSCAR
M: Doesn’t mean it’s a good idea...
M: THERESA
M: Is this what you were thinking about when
M: you were up last night?
M: OSCAR
M: How do you know I was up last night?
M: THERESA
M: Well, it’s a big deal.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 19.

M: Isabel.
M: JONATHAN
M: You must be Isabel.
M: She’s taken aback.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: I’m Jonathan.
M: He extends his hand and she shakes it dubiously.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: I’m here to take you to your meeting.
M: She looks at him.
M: ISABEL
M: OK.
M: They look at each other awkwardly for a moment. He smiles
M: and extends his arm as if to say, ‘after you’.
M: 44 EXT. BOWERY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 44
M: They emerge onto the busy street.
M: JONATHAN
M: How’s the hotel? Are you comfortable?
M: ISABEL
M: Yes.
M: He seems happy.
M: JONATHAN
M: Good. I chose it myself.
M: They arrive at the curb and Jonathan raises his hand,
M: beckoning the Tesla which waits at the corner.
M: Jonathan opens the door which swings upward, like a
M: spaceship. Isabel is startled.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 20.
M: 45 INT. TESLA - MINUTES LATER 45
M: Isabel tries to get her window down but can’t seem to
M: find the right button. Jonathan helps.
M: JONATHAN
M: Is it the french spelling?
M: She looks at him.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: (with accent)
M: “Isabelle.”
M: ISABEL
M: I S A B E L.
M: JONATHAN
M: Ah, that’s not the french.
M: Another awkward moment. Isabel looks out at the city.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Have you ever met Theresa?
M: ISABEL
M: No.
M: JONATHAN
M: She’s very impressive. She built
M: ‘Horizon’ from nothing 22 years ago, and
M: now it’s one of the biggest media buying
M: companies in the world.
M: ISABEL
M: Media buying?
M: JONATHAN
M: We connect brands to consumers and vice
M: versa, through an understanding of
M: demographics and Psycho-graphics.
M: Isabel looks at him blankly.
M: ISABEL
M: So, what do you sell?
M: JONATHAN
M: Whatever the client is selling.
M: She nods, half understanding.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 21.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: It’s Theresa’s brain child. Don’t be
M: intimidated by her. That’s a mistake.
M: ISABEL
M: Sounds like you know her well.
M: He smiles.
M: JONATHAN
M: I’ve worked at the company for 4 years.
M: (admitting)
M: And she’s my mother in-law... or will be
M: on Saturday. I’m marrying her daughter.
M: ISABEL
M: Oh. Congratulations.
M: JONATHAN
M: (happy)
M: Thanks.
M: 46 INT. HORIZON WAITING AREA - DAY 46
M: Isabel sits, waiting. Modern and beautiful. Lots of
M: glass. Stunning view of the city. After a moment,
M: Theresa’s executive assistant, GWEN (30’s), approaches
M: Isabel.
M: GWEN
M: Isabel.
M: She stands.
M: GWEN (CONT’D)
M: Follow me.
M: 47 INT. HORIZON OFFICE HALLS AND STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 47
M: Isabel follows Gwen down the labyrinth modern hallways -
M: up a staircase, past walls of glass and employees. And
M: finally:
M: 48 INT. HALL JUST OUTSIDE THERESA’S PRIVATE CONFERENCE ROOM 48
M: Gwen and Isabel arrive and stop. Glass windows allow us
M: to see in.
M: Inside, Theresa is just finishing up a meeting with SIMON
M: (43), TANYA (55) and Bill (60), her lawyer. They have
M: someone on a conference call.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 22.
M: GWEN
M: Sorry, they are almost finished. Can I
M: get you a water?
M: ISABEL
M: No, thank you.
M: A phone on Gwen’s desk rings from down the hall.
M: GWEN
M: Excuse me.
M: Gwen hustles to get it. Isabel waits awkwardly shifting
M: her gaze between the conference room and the view out the
M: window.
M: We can just hear Theresa and the others though they are
M: muted by the glass.
M: THERESA
M: (into the phone)
M: Christine...
M: (getting irritated)
M: Christine! Here is the important point.
M: The valuation potentially changes if this
M: leaks into next quarter. If getting it
M: done quickly means conceding a few of
M: these points, then do it. *
M: Theresa sees Isabel. *
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: I need to go.
M: SIMON *
M: (Into speaker phone) *
M: Tanya and I will call you back in a bit *
M: with some suggestions. *
M: He hangs up. Theresa looks at her team. *
M: THERESA
M: (to her team)
M: I’m not sure why we hired someone to
M: guide us through the process, who we now
M: need to guide through the process.
M: TANYA
M: She’s just not a great communicator. But
M: she’s been through this before with other
M: companies, which is valuable.
M: Theresa heads out of the conference room toward Isabel.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 22A.
M: THERESA
M: Okay. But can we think about
M: renegotiating her fee because we’re doing
M: most of the work here.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 23.
M: Tanya nods. Theresa stands and exits the conference.
M: 49 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM 49
M: Theresa approaches Isabel.
M: THERESA
M: You must be Isabel.
M: Isabel nods with a tense smile and Theresa extends her
M: hand.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Theresa.
M: Theresa takes her in for a moment, then looks out the
M: window.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: On a clear day you can see New Jersey
M: from here. Don’t know why you’d want to.
M: Isabel doesn’t get it.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Let’s go to my office.
M: 50 INT. HORIZON, THERESA’S OFFICE 50
M: Isabel and Theresa walk in. Beautiful furniture, a wall
M: of wood and a huge photograph of the ocean above her
M: seating area.
M: THERESA
M: You had a long trip.
M: Isabel nods.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Please sit.
M: Isabel sits.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Was it comfortable?
M: ISABEL
M: It was fine.
M: Theresa nods and takes a seat opposite Isabel. She gets
M: down to it.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 24.
M: THERESA
M: So, I watched the video that my group
M: brought back from India.
M: ISABEL
M: What’s really going on there can’t be
M: understood though a video.
M: THERESA
M: It gives a sense.
M: ISABEL
M: There are over two hundred thousand child
M: prostitutes in the south alone. And five
M: times that amount suffer from
M: malnutrition. The numbers triple when you
M: go the bigger cities.
M: Isabel takes a paper out of the folder she is holding.
M: She hands it to Theresa. It has figures, numbers and
M: graphs. Theresa looks at it while Isabel continues.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: (bitter)
M: Hundreds of thousands die from minor
M: illnesses, infections. Completely
M: preventable, with very little money if
M: someone had the inclination.
M: Theresa studies her.
M: THERESA
M: It’s infuriating isn’t it.
M: Isabel taken back by the question.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Because it’s preventable.
M: Gwen pops in.
M: GWEN
M: Sorry to interrupt. I have the caterers
M: on the line. They want to know if they
M: can use mussels and shrimp for the
M: risotto. There’s a lobster shortage.
M: THERESA
M: Is there a lobster shortage, or can they
M: not get enough lobster?
M: She stands there.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 24A.
M: GWEN
M: I’m not sure.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 25.
M: THERESA
M: Well, then let me know when you find out.
M: The assistant retreats to call the caterer.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: You’ve caught me at a busy time. My
M: daughter is getting married this weekend.
M: ISABEL
M: Yes. I met your son-in-law.
M: THERESA
M: Jonathan.
M: Theresa stands and picks up a framed photo of Grace.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Grace is young. But she says she’s in *
M: love. I could fight her on this and tell
M: her she’s too young and have her hate me -
M: I’ve tried that. Or I could give her a
M: beautiful wedding.
M: Theresa hands Isabel the framed picture. Isabel looks
M: down at it. A beautiful picture of Grace stares back at
M: her.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Do you have kids?
M: Isabel shakes her head, ‘no’.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Partner? *
M: ISABEL
M: No. My work is all consuming.
M: THERESA
M: I understand. I really wanted a family.
M: I think a lot of women believe it’ll just
M: happen on its own.
M: Isabel isn’t sure if this is a criticism.
M: THERESA (CONT'D)
M: But personally, I think if you want it,
M: you have to make it happen. I have 2
M: little boys too. I worked hard for them. *
M: Theresa takes the picture back and replaces it on the
M: shelf.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 26.
M: Isabel tries to refocus the conversation. She reaches
M: into her bag and pulls out another folder.
M: ISABEL
M: I have a list of priorities here.
M: Eventually we’d like to take in three
M: times the number of children.
M: Theresa glances at the folder then walks to her desk as
M: Isabel continues.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: Change our food program. Subsidize and
M: buy from local farmers. Vaccinate. Which
M: could be done for under 5 dollars per
M: child.
M: Theresa nods.
M: THERESA
M: What you’re doing is very impressive.
M: It’s important work.
M: Isabel gives a tense smile.
M: THERESA (CONT'D)
M: But there are a lot of good, deserving
M: organizations out there. I need some more *
M: time to think. *
M: Isabel is surprised and annoyed.
M: ISABEL
M: What? I... I was under the impression
M: that you had already decided to be
M: involved.
M: She grabs the graphs off of the table.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: (getting upset)
M: Look at the information. The need is
M: undeniable.
M: THERESA
M: I have a big weekend ahead of me and I
M: feel like I need the time. Leave the
M: folder. Monday we’ll have lunch and I’ll
M: let you know what I can do.
M: Isabel is fuming, but holds it in.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 27.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: In the meantime, come to the wedding. We
M: can get to know each other better.
M: ISABEL
M: I’m heading directly back to India.
M: THERESA
M: Staying the weekend won’t kill you. It’s
M: a big party. You won’t be uncomfortable,
M: I promise.
M: Isabel is stuck. The door opens and her assistant comes
M: in comes in.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Gwen, get Isabel an invitation to the
M: wedding.
M: GWEN
M: Right away. And Dr. Cahill is here for
M: the insurance work up.
M: ISABEL
M: I need a physical?
M: THERESA
M: Not you. Me. There are a lot of hoops to
M: jump through when you’re selling your
M: company. See you tomorrow.
M: Theresa smiles at her. The doctor is shown in. Isabel
M: walks out. We go with her.
M: 51 INT. HORIZON, HALLWAYS 51
M: Isabel makes her way out. We stay close on her as she
M: makes her way through the maze like office toward the
M: front. Hard to read her.
M: 52 INT. HORIZON, ELEVATOR BANK - CONTINUOUS 52
M: As Isabel approaches the elevator bank, she suddenly
M: bails out through the emergency exit and into the back
M: stair well.
M: 53 INT. HORIZON, BACK STAIRWELL 53
M: Isabel takes off her shoes and begins running down.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 28.
M: 54 EXT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY AND LAWN - DAY 54
M: A lot of action on the lawn. Trucks in the driveway,
M: people setting up for the wedding.
M: Theresa's car wends down the long driveway toward the big
M: house. It stops and Theresa gets out.
M: She heads across the lawn toward Oscar, who is speaking
M: to the wedding planner, MELINDA. She looks slightly
M: frantic.
M: Before Theresa can get to them, the twins, Otto and Theo
M: ambush her.
M: Her face lights up as they run into her arms. She bends
M: to scoop them up and they almost all topple over.
M: She laughs.
M: THERESA
M: Hello my little cookies...
M: She covers them in kisses. They laugh and resist - and
M: love it.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Chocolate chip... and peanut butter...
M: TWINS
M: No! Not peanut butter!
M: THERESA
M: Oh that’s right, someone is allergic!
M: Sugar then...
M: She pretends to eat their cheeks.
M: They point to the sky where a a hi-tech drone with a
M: camera mounted soars above them.
M: TWINS
M: Mom, mom. Look. The man let us fly it. I
M: was making it go.
M: Theresa watches as the drone flies back to the young man
M: who is controlling it.
M: THERESA
M: Wow! Just don’t fly away.
M: TWINS
M: It’s not for people! It’s going to take
M: pictures of the wedding.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 29.
M: Theresa looks over at Oscar who is engaged with the
M: wedding planner MELINDA.
M: THERESA
M: Ohhh I see. Have you seen your sister?
M: TWINS
M: She told us to stay away from her.
M: THERESA
M: Well, brides are crabby.
M: Theresa stands.
M: THERESA (CONT'D)
M: Go ask that man if you can fly it again.
M: They run off. Theresa walks to Oscar.
M: 55 EXT. LAWN 55
M: Theresa walks up to Oscar. They smile at each other in
M: acknowledgement of how much is going on.
M: OSCAR
M: I nixed the ice sculptures. Melinda’s
M: having a fit.
M: They look over at some huge ice sculptures which are
M: being carried away around the side of the house.
M: Melinda is frantically point to the men where to put
M: them. Theresa and Oscar watch her.
M: THERESA
M: I guess this isn’t the time to tell her
M: we need one more chair.
M: Oscar looks at her, quizzically.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Somebody from work.
M: Oscar sighs.
M: OSCAR
M: I think I just won’t tell her and add it
M: when she’s not looking.
M: Another scream. The boys are buzzing Melinda with the
M: drone. She is ducking.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 30.
M: THERESA
M: Where’s Gracie?
M: Oscar looks toward the epic tent. Another kiss.
M: 56 EXT. WEDDING AREA, BACK OF HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 56
M: Lush and beautiful. Tables are being set, flowers placed.
M: Theresa sees Grace counting chairs, excitedly and
M: anxiously.
M: Theresa takes Grace in for a moment then approaches her.
M: Grace turns and sees Theresa and gives her a wide,
M: nervous smile.
M: Theresa smiles back. They go to each other and hug.
M: GRACE
M: Can you believe this is happening?
M: THERESA
M: No, I can’t. Are you okay? Any doubts?
M: GRACE
M: You wish.
M: Theresa holds her face and looks right at her.
M: THERESA
M: No. I wish what you wish.
M: Grace smiles and hugs her mom again.
M: GRACE
M: Thank you.
M: THERESA
M: I don’t see what would be so wrong with
M: just living together for a year...
M: Grace has heard this before.
M: GRACE
M: Really?
M: THERESA
M: And, he’s not as good looking as you.
M: She’s clearly used to this.
M: GRACE
M: Anything else?
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 31.
M: The look at each other deeply again.
M: THERESA
M: Yes. You’ll always be mine. Remember
M: that.
M: This clearly touches Grace, but she tries to slough it
M: off, but it makes her emotional.
M: GRACE
M: You are honestly the worst. And try, if
M: you can to get all of your crying done
M: before the wedding, because it sets me
M: off.
M: Theresa puts her hand up like she is taking an oath.
M: 57 INT. HOUSE, STAIRWAY 57
M: Theresa walks up the stairs.
M: 58 INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S BEDROOM 58
M: Theresa enters the bedroom. She walks through the room
M: into her dressing room/closet.
M: 59 INT. THERESA’ DRESSING ROOM/CLOSET 59
M: It’s big enough to be another bedroom. Meticulously
M: organized. Her dress for the wedding hangs on the far
M: side of the closet, ready for tomorrow.
M: She takes off her shoes.
M: AT HER BUREAU, she removes her earrings and other
M: jewelry. Places it on a tray.
M: Next to the tray we see the bird nest with the three
M: little cracked eggs in it, that she brought back from her
M: walk.
M: Theresa opens a drawer where she keeps a pill box with
M: pills/vitamins divided into daily doses. She grabs
M: “Friday”, puts the pills in her mouth, and swallows them
M: without water.
M: ON THE CLOSET WINDOW, we hang on an empty frame.
M: Theresa walks up to the window. Expression unreadable.
M: THERESA’S VIEW OUTSIDE
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 32.
M: She looks out at the big oak tree. Branches outstretched
M: like arms. She breathes in. Breathes out. Breathes in.
M: Breathes out.
M: Then out the window, what looks like a bird, flies over
M: the tree. She leans closer to discover it’s the drone. It
M: flies high above the tree, swooping this way and that. We
M: hear the children’s giggles from below.
M: Theresa closes her eyes and we see:
M: THE DRONE POV
M: Swooping, beautiful aerials of the tree, the house, the
M: people below. And it climbs, up, and up, and up.
M: BACK ON THERESA
M: She opens her eyes and her face breaks into a cry. She
M: covers her mouth to muffle it.
M: 60 INT. AERIAL SHOT OF LOWER MANHATTAN 60
M: We close in on the Bowery Hotel penthouse.
M: 61 EXT. BOWERY HOTEL - EVENING/ EXT. INDIA ORPHANAGE 61
M: Isabel is out on the balcony looking over the city, on
M: the phone with Jai.
M: ISABEL
M: Yes, it’s big. But also small. All the
M: buildings are squeezed together into a
M: small, small space.
M: JAI
M: Would I like it?
M: She seems to actually reflect on the question. Looks out.
M: ISABEL
M: One day maybe you will see it for
M: yourself.
M: JAI
M: Are there birds?
M: Isabel looks out at the pigeons.
M: ISABEL
M: Kind of. But not like we are used to.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 33.
M: She stands and looks through the glass into the room
M: where two Housekeepers have let themselves in.
M: VIEW INSIDE THE ROOM
M: Housekeepers are followed by the Hotel Manager. They
M: carry 2 different dresses on hangers.
M: Isabel looks puzzled. The Manager waves and directs
M: Housekeeping to hang the dresses so they are on display.
M: JAI
M: When will you be back?
M: Isabel looks through the window at the dresses.
M: ISABEL
M: As soon as I can. But you need to set an
M: example for the others while I’m gone.
M: He nods, though of course she can’t see it.
M: ISABEL (CONT'D)
M: Can you hand the phone to Preena?
M: JAI
M: Okay, goodbye Ms. Isabel.
M: Jai hands the phone off.
M: PREENA
M: So, what do you think?
M: ISABEL
M: I think we could get 100 new beds for
M: what they are paying for this hotel
M: suite.
M: PREENA
M: I hope this wasn’t too good to be true.
M: ISABEL
M: I’m not coming back without...
M: PREENA
M: ... A suitcase of money. I know.
M: ISABEL
M: Yes, I’ll call you soon.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 34.
M: 62 INT. BOWERY HOTEL PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 62
M: Isabel enters.
M: ISABEL
M: What’s this?
M: The Manager stands in presentation.
M: MANAGER
M: Ms. Young thought you might need a dress
M: for the wedding.
M: Isabel takes them in.
M: 63 EXT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE - WEDDING DAY - AFTERNOON 63
M: The grounds look beautiful. Lanterns line the driveway.
M: Around back, the ceremony is about to start.
M: 64 EXT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S BACK YARD - SAME 64
M: Theresa, Oscar, and Grace, all dressed in their wedding
M: attire. They stand on a little brick patio in front of a
M: small greenhouse; waiting. About 50 feet away, the guests
M: are seated, waiting.
M: Oscar and Theresa stand on either side of Grace. They
M: look across at her, and then anxiously to each other.
M: Grace looks straight ahead, avoiding their gaze. Theresa
M: reaches up to Grace to fix a stray hair. Grace pulls away
M: annoyed.
M: GRACE
M: Please...
M: Theresa nods. They settle back into waiting. After a
M: moment:
M: OSCAR
M: You look beautiful, sweetheart.
M: GRACE
M: You’ve told me that... A lot.
M: (Thank you)
M: THERESA
M: Well, it’s true.
M: Grace takes a deep breath.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 35.
M: GRACE
M: (tense)
M: Thank you... Again.
M: Waiting. Then music begins. They jump, startled. Then
M: gather themselves, and begin walking.
M: 65 EXT. HOUSE, BACK LAWN - CONTINUOUS 65
M: About 75 people. Everyone turns to see the bride and her
M: parents as they walk up the isle.
M: Jonathan smiles as he waits at the front, next to the
M: Buddhist monk who will be preforming the ceremony.
M: People take out their phones to take some pictures and
M: videos.
M: ON Grace, all smiles as she arrives next to Jonathan. Her
M: parents kiss her, then take their seats.
M: Looking between the Bride and Groom, we see the beautiful
M: stone sculpture Oscar was finishing earlier. It’s an
M: abstract depiction of 2 entwined bodies. Somewhere
M: between Picasso and Giacometti.
M: 66 EXT. PARKWAY - SAME 66
M: The tesla sits on the Grand Central parkway in terrible
M: traffic.
M: 67 INT. TESLA - CONTINUOUS 67
M: Isabel is dressed nicely but still in her own Indian
M: flavored outfit, having opted not to wear Theresa’s
M: dresses. She anxiously tries to look past the traffic.
M: DRIVER
M: We might be a little late, but I won’t
M: let you miss it.
M: Up ahead we see a State Patroller dealing with a stopped
M: vehicle.
M: 68 EXT. PARKWAY 68
M: The Tesla drives up on the shoulder and scoots around the
M: mess, then takes off down the freeway.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 36.
M: 69 EXT. HOUSE DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON 69
M: The Tesla pulls in. The door flips open and Isabel rushes
M: out. One of the wedding staff points her toward the
M: house.
M: She kicks off her shoes and runs up toward the wedding.
M: 70 EXT. HOUSE, BACK YARD, WEDDING AREA 70
M: The monk delivers the vows.
M: MONK
M: Remember to be patient with yourselves
M: and others, knowing that change comes
M: slowly and gradually. Seek inspiration
M: from your family and friends.
M: Theresa and Oscar sit in the front, a mixture of nerves
M: and excitement.
M: An usher quietly shows Isabel to a seat in the back.
M: A few people turn to look at her. She smiles
M: uncomfortably and tries to focus on the ceremony.
M: MONK (CONT’D)
M: To make your relationship work will take
M: love. This is the core of your marriage
M: and why you are here, today.
M: IN FRONT: Theresa puts her hand on Oscar’s leg. Oscar
M: looks at Theresa and smiles.
M: IN BACK: Isabel takes it all in. Gradually, her eyes fall
M: on Oscar’s profile. She freezes.
M: MONK (CONT’D)
M: It will take trust, to know, that in your
M: hearts, you truly want what is best for
M: each other. It will take dedication, to
M: stay open to one another - and to learn
M: and grow together.
M: Heart beating out of her chest, Isabel leans in subtly
M: trying to see Oscar more clearly.
M: MONK (CONT’D)
M: It will take faith, to go forward
M: together, without knowing exactly what
M: the future brings. And it will take
M: commitment, to hold true to the journey
M: you both have pledged to today.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 37.
M: Again on Oscar’s profile from Isabel’s perspective.
M: Quick cut.
M: FEET RUNNING ON THE BEACH
M: SWIMMING IN THE DARK OCEAN
M: TWO BODIES INTERTWINED ON A BEACH.
M: BACK TO PRESENT
M: Isabel quickly stands and heads in the back door of the
M: house.
M: 71 INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, FOYER/LIVING ROOM 71
M: Isabel paces nervously in the front foyer.
M: She catches herself in the reflection of the glass and
M: tries to gather herself. She looks back outside through
M: window where the bride is just kissing the groom. Guests
M: stand and cheer. She sees Oscar as he cranes his head to
M: look to where Isabel was sitting.
M: A72 INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS A72
M: Isabel walks in and takes in her surroundings. Beautiful,
M: expensive art on the wall by the fireplace.
M: A grand piano. A small metal sculpture by the window that
M: looks like a man, looking out.
M: Art books are laid out on the table. She goes over to
M: one. It’s a catalogue from a show. She looks down at the
M: cover.
M: “Oscar Carlson, Sculpture 2003-2010”
M: She leafs through a couple pages. Arrives at his picture
M: in the front. He looks younger. She lingers on it for a
M: moment. A staff member startles her.
M: STAFF
M: Miss? Drinks are being served on the side
M: porch.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 37A.
M: 72 EXT. SIDE PORCH AREA - MINUTES LATER 72
M: The guests mill about, celebrating. The twins chase each
M: other around through the chairs and guests. On the bar
M: are listed the specialty drinks “The Grace” and “The
M: Jonathan”
M: People congratulate the happy couple.
M: Isabel steps out onto the back porch, but keeps her
M: distance from the party. Everyone is in celebration mode.
M: The photographer gathers the bride and the groom’s
M: families together for a group shot.
M: Isabel continues to watch from a distance. As the picture
M: is being taken, Oscar’s gaze falls on Isabel standing in
M: the background. Time seems to stop as they look at each
M: other.
M: Close on each of them staring across a sea of people.
M: They seem to be the only two people there.
M: Oscar excuses himself from the group and approaches
M: Isabel.
M: As he steps in near her, the electricity is palpable. He
M: looks confused and isn’t sure what to say.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 38.
M: OSCAR
M: What are you doing here?
M: Isabel takes a deep breath.
M: ON THERESA, as she spots Isabel talking to Oscar. Theresa
M: excuses herself and heads over.
M: THERESA
M: Isabel, I’m so glad you could make it.
M: Isabel tries to mask her discomfort.
M: ISABEL
M: Congratulations. It was a beautiful
M: ceremony. What I saw, at least. There was
M: an accident. And I was stuck in traffic.
M: THERESA
M: Oh no. Well, you made it for the party.
M: She studies Isabel for a moment.
M: THERESA (CONT’D)
M: Did you meet my husband?
M: Isabel nods, awkwardly.
M: THERESA (CONT'D)
M: (to Oscar)
M: Isabel runs an orphanage in India I may
M: be funding.
M: Oscar is reeling. He nods. *
M: Grace appears, glowing with nervous energy.
M: GRACE
M: Mom, do you think I should change my
M: dress before dinner?
M: THERESA
M: Keep it on sweetheart. People love to see
M: the bride in her dress.
M: Grace is beaming. Her eyes fall on Isabel.
M: ISABEL
M: Congratulations.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 38A.
M: GRACE
M: Thank you.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 39.
M: THERESA
M: Gracie, this is Isabel.
M: The smile at each other
M: ISABEL
M: It’s a beautiful dress.
M: GRACE
M: Isn’t it? It’s my moms.
M: THERESA
M: Yours now.
M: Grace smiles. Oscar stands by in a stunned silence.
M: Isabel gives a tense smile. Jonathan appears.
M: JONATHAN
M: Baby, People are staring to sit down
M: already, let’s head over.
M: He sees Isabel.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Oh hi. Glad you could make it.
M: GRACE
M: You know each other?
M: JONATHAN
M: I drove her to the office the other day
M: to meet your mom.
M: Some awkward smiles. The photographer comes over and
M: pushes them all together.
M: PHOTOGRAPHER
M: Let’s get a picture.
M: Nothing to do but pose. Couldn’t be more awkward. The
M: camera snaps.
M: GRACE
M: Dad, come on.
M: OSCAR
M: Okay, sweetheart.
M: GRACE
M: (to Isabel)
M: You too?
M: Isabel nods uncomfortably.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 39A.
M: JONATHAN
M: We’re going to party like it’s 2019.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 40.
M: Some minor laughter. Grace pushed him playfully.
M: 73 OMITTED 73
M: 74 INT. TENT - LATE, LATE - AFTERNOON 74
M: Beautifully decorated with flowers. Filled with guests
M: and waiters buzzing about.
M: Everyone enjoys themselves. Young and old.
M: Close on the menu in the middle of a table: “Lobster
M: Risotto”.
M: Two long tables holding 40 each. Isabel is down in
M: Siberia with a few of the more peripheral guests. Mostly
M: older, except for one conservatively handsome man, FRANK
M: (late 40’s) who sits next to her. She glances at him.
M: Only a lone piece of meat sitting on his plate. At the
M: front, Jonathan calls everyone to attention.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 41.
M: FRANK
M: I’m on this paleo thing. Training for a
M: Tri. In Hawaii, on the big island.
M: Isabel looks at him then back to the front where Jonathan
M: calls everyone to attention.
M: JONATHAN
M: Hi everyone. I want to welcome all of
M: you.
M: He takes a deep breath and looks at the big crowd.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Wow. I thought the saying ‘I do’ part
M: would be the hardest.
M: People laugh. Grace rolls her eyes. Jonathan rubs her
M: back. Theresa and Oscar smile at each other.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Thank you for coming to celebrate with
M: us.
M: He takes a speech out of his pocket.
M: JONATHAN (CONT'D)
M: When I started working for Theresa at
M: ‘Horizon’, right out of school...
M: FRIEND
M: You can say Harvard!
M: They laugh. Grace shakes her head. Jonathan smiles and
M: continues.
M: JONATHAN
M: I thought I was just getting a great job
M: for one of the most forward-thinking,
M: entrepreneurs I had ever read about.
M: Theresa smiles, a little uncomfortable.
M: JONATHAN (CONT'D)
M: But very quickly I came to dread coming
M: into work. It wasn’t my boss’ fault.
M: Well, sort of it was. You see two years
M: ago, Grace started coming in with
M: Theresa. She was working in the design
M: department for the summer.
M: Grace shakes her head, embarrassed.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 42.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: She’s an amazing artist, for any of you
M: who don’t know. Anyway, I saw them
M: coming through the lobby; these two
M: beautiful, powerful women. And I froze.
M: (to Grace and Theresa)
M: In fact, there was room in your elevator,
M: but I couldn’t bring myself to get in.
M: People think it’s cute. An older women at Isabel’s table
M: makes an aside to her friend.
M: OLDER WOMAN
M: (to her friend)
M: Which one is he in love with?
M: JONATHAN
M: Well, I spent the next month trying to
M: find a way to be in the same place at the
M: same time with Grace. And finally, I
M: braved an elevator ride with her.
M: Grace blushes.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Do you remember my genius banter?
M: She nods.
M: GRACE
M: “What floor?”
M: Everyone laughs.
M: JONATHAN
M: I would plan things to say when I saw
M: her, but they never came out. Until one
M: day, I got lucky.
M: People hoot.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Not like that you perverts!
M: Roaring.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: We were in the company pub, and she was
M: on line right in front of me. And she had
M: forgotten her wallet. So I paid. Best $14
M: I ever spent.
M: Some applause.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 43.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: Grace, I love you more than anything. And
M: I couldn’t be happier that you agreed to
M: marry me. Even if it was out of guilt
M: about owing me money.
M: Grace stands and they kiss. Everyone claps. It goes on
M: for a while and the crowd loves it.
M: Theresa smiles at them and Oscar tries to, but it’s going
M: on a while.
M: At Isabel’s table, Frank leans in.
M: FRANK
M: That’s going to be a fun honeymoon.
M: The bride and groom pull apart. Grace remains standing
M: and clinks her glass.
M: GRACE
M: Hi, Hi. You’re not quite free yet!
M: Grace’s hand shakes as she speaks. Oscar takes it.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: Sorry. Those of you who know me, know how
M: much I love to speak in public.
M: Some laughter. Isabel watches her. Grace gathers herself,
M: fighting through her shyness.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: Jonathan, I love you. And I am so happy
M: to be your wife.
M: (blushing)
M: I can’t believe I can say that!
M: (deep breath)
M: But this speech isn’t for you, it’s for
M: Mom and Dad.
M: She turns to her dad, whose hand she is still holding.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: Dad, I don’t know a girl who is closer
M: with her father than I am with you. And I
M: am so grateful for that.
M: (pause)
M: Most of the time.
M: Oscar beams at her.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 44.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: I’ve gotten so much from you. My sulking,
M: my sense of humor... Unfortunately my
M: nose... And my love for art; my drawing.
M: We see the audience in rapt attention.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: Not many fathers would have done what you
M: did at such a young age.
M: They clearly have a special connection. Isabel is
M: fascinated.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: (to Oscar)
M: And thank you for your beautiful gift.
M: She motions to the carved statue which has now been moved
M: behind them in the tent. People oooh and ahh and clap.
M: Oscar smiles and kisses her hand. He beams.
M: JONATHAN
M: (joke to the room, re:
M: sculpture)
M: I’m not sure if it’s me and Grace, or
M: Grace and her dad!
M: Some laugh awkwardly, but the joke doesn’t go over well
M: with Oscar. Theresa makes eye contact with Oscar.
M: JONATHAN (CONT’D)
M: I’m kidding, of course. We absolutely
M: love it.
M: Grace turns her attention to Theresa.
M: GRACE
M: And mom.
M: Theresa looks at her wide-eyed, with tears brewing. Grace
M: looks like she might go over the edge as well.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: I told you to get your crying out
M: yesterday!
M: Theresa laughs and pushes away a tear.
M: THERESA
M: I tried.
M: The room laughs. Grace composes herself and continues.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 45.
M: GRACE
M: You have made this day so special. Thank
M: you for putting up with my pre-wedding
M: craziness.
M: Grace gathers.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: You are the most caring, loving, strong,
M: best example of a woman I could have ever
M: had for a mother.
M: She looks down for a moment.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: And for those of you who don’t know, I
M: had the rare experience of getting to
M: choose my own mother.
M: Isabel sits up. Tension building in her.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: It was just me and dad for the first year
M: of my life.
M: Grace takes a moment.
M: GRACE (CONT'D)
M: ... After my birth mother wasn’t well
M: enough to care for me.
M: On Isabel, frozen.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: And dad and I went everywhere together;
M: me strapped to his chest.
M: On the crowd in rapt attention.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: One day, we were walking down the street
M: in Soho. And this beautiful woman, with
M: shockingly red hair, had just moved to
M: the neighborhood and was looking for a
M: good place to have a coffee. I guess my
M: dad and I looked like locals, so she came
M: up, and asked if we knew of a place.
M: She turns to her dad.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: And what did you say?
M: He smiles.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 46.
M: OSCAR
M: I said; “I don’t drink coffee, so I
M: wouldn’t know”.
M: Some laughter. Theresa remembers. Isabel is spinning.
M: GRACE
M: And that would have been that, except, I
M: had grabbed hold of her hair, and I
M: wouldn’t let her go.
M: Tears roll. Theresa and Grace hold hands.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: So my dad really had no choice but to
M: start drinking coffee.
M: People clap.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: (a long beat)
M: I’m so happy I chose you.
M: Everyone is near tears. Grace takes a deep breath.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: To my parents for giving me this
M: wonderful life, and this beautiful night.
M: And, oh yeah... to angelic brothers...
M: The boys smile and play and pretend to fart in her
M: direction.
M: GRACE (CONT’D)
M: I love you.
M: She raises a glass. The guests stand, clap, cheer. A
M: guest yells out.
M: GUEST
M: (Toasting)
M: To Grace and Jonathan!
M: We are with Isabel who is frozen in her seat. She stares
M: off into the middle distance for a few moments.
M: FRANK
M: (encouraging her to get up)
M: Hey, we’re toasting.
M: She stands and heads out of the tent. Most of the guests
M: are caught up in the toast and don’t notice, but Oscar
M: does.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 47.
M: On Isabel as she walks out of the tent.
M: 75 EXT. BOAT DOCK - DUSK 75
M: Isabel sits by herself on a bench on a dock jutting out
M: into the water, out of sight of the festivities.
M: She tries to gather herself and put all this together.
M: Suddenly up the dock walks Frank with two glasses and a
M: bottle of champagne. She sees him and shakes her head to
M: herself. He approaches.
M: FRANK
M: I couldn’t agree more. I’m not into
M: weddings.
M: He sits next to her with the glasses and the bottle.
M: ISABEL
M: I’d like to be alone.
M: FRANK
M: Tell me about it. Crowds are awful.
M: He pours her glass. She pushes it away. When he tries to
M: hand it to her.
M: FRANK (CONT’D)
M: I can take one for the team and drink
M: them both.
M: She can’t believe any of this is happening.
M: FRANK (CONT’D)
M: You know how at every wedding there are
M: always a few single people pretending not
M: to care that they’re single? Well, we’re
M: those people. Weird, huh? I’m divorced.
M: What’s your story?
M: ISABEL
M: My story is; I’d like to be alone.
M: FRANK
M: (trying to be charming)
M: You think you want to be alone...
M: ISABEL
M: Get the fuck away from me.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 48.
M: She gets up and walks away.
M: FRANK
M: Okay...
M: 76 EXT. TENT AREA - NIGHT 76
M: Isabel approaches the tent purposefully.
M: Inside, all the guests mill about, some dancing. Jonathan
M: spins Grace.
M: Theresa and Oscar watch happily.
M: Outside, Isabel hangs in the shadows, watching.
M: CLOSE ON GRACE as ISABEL WATCHES HER, STUDYING HER FACE.
M: Oscar’s vision is drawn to Isabel. She looks back at him.
M: Between the two of them, Grace and Jonathan dance.
M: Isabel steps closer, staring intently at Oscar.
M: After another moment, Oscar breaks away from the crowd
M: and heads toward Isabel.
M: 77 EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS 77
M: Oscar walks by Isabel, who follows him away from the
M: entrance and the party guests inside.
M: They stand and face each other.
M: ISABEL
M: What did you do?
M: Oscar looks at her.
M: OSCAR
M: What are you talking about?
M: ISABEL
M: Don’t. Too much adds up.
M: Oscar looks behind him at the tent then back to Isabel.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: But then I think, you wouldn’t have done
M: that.
M: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 49.
M: He looks nervously behind him at the tent where people
M: are starting to head out onto the lawn. Oscar doesn’t
M: know what to say.
M: ISABEL (CONT’D)
M: I can see it.
M: All Oscar can do is look away and shake his head. We
M: don’t know if it means ‘no’, or ‘I can’t believe this’.
M: He looks right up at her.
M: OSCAR
M: Isabel. We can’t talk about this now.
M: A party worker opens the tent and makes an announcement.
M: PARTY WORKER
M: Fireworks are starting! Follow the
M: lanterns...
M: Party workers stand outside in a line ready to hand out
M: sparklers and drinks to people as they exit the tent. The
M: guests whoop it up on the way out of the tent to the
M: beach for the fireworks.
M: Oscar looks from them to Isabel.
M: OSCAR
M: I have to go. I’ll call you tomorrow.
M: Oscar backs away, then moves to join Theresa, Grace, and
M: the others who pour out of the tent.
M: Isabel watches, in shock.
M: 78 EXT. DRIVEWAY OF HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 78
M: Isabel walks away from the party down the big lawn,
M: toward the driveway where the cars are lined.
M: Behind her, a huge bang, and the sky is lit up by the
M: first of the fireworks.
M: 79 EXT. BACK LAWN, OVER LOOKING WATER - NIGHT 79
M: The crowd ooh’s and ahh’s at the fireworks display.

C: OSCAR
D: Why’d you do it?
N: Theresa gets close and lays on his chest.

N: Oscar looks back at her, dubiously. 84 INT./EXT. BOWERY HOTEL PENTHOUSE - MORNING 84 Isabel sits out on the balcony wrapped in a blanket, phone in her lap. She hasn’t slept. The phone rings and she runs in to pick it up. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 51.
C: ISABEL
D: Hello...
N: Her face falls with disappointment. We can just hear the voice leaking through the phone.
C: HOUSEKEEPING
E: O.C.
D: Hi Ms. Andersen. We are calling to check to see if you need more towels, or new linens?

TAXI, GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY - DAY 86 Isabel sits in the back staring out the window. Her Indian driver is on the phone with a headset in. He speaks to the person on the line in Bengali.
C: DRIVER

N: On Isabel. He looks in the mirror.
C: DRIVER

E: In English
D: You want to hear some music?

C: JONATHAN
D: It’s a blanket...?
C: GRACE
D: No, I think it’s a table cloth.
C: JONATHAN
D: Maybe it’s a cape.
N: Oscar looks closely.
C: OSCAR
D: I think it might be the confederate flag.
N: They laugh. Theresa looks at the card.
C: THERESA
D: I think it’s one of our lawyers...
C: OSCAR
D: Who you should order a background check on.
N: Theresa laughs. The doorbell rings. 88 INT. FRONT HALL 88 Theresa opens the door. It’s Isabel. They look at each other for a long moment.

C: GRACE
E: CONT'D
D: Isabel, right?
N: Isabel uncomfortably nods.
C: GRACE
E: CONT’D
D: Thanks for coming yesterday.
N: Isabel is taken with her.
C: ISABEL
E: awkwardly
D: Of course. Thank you for having me.
N: Oscar stands.

C: THERESA
D: Would you like something to drink?
C: ISABEL
D: No.
N: Theresa and Oscar look at each other.
C: THERESA
D: Why don’t we show you around?
N: She nods and they begin to head out of the room. The air is heavy.
C: JONATHAN
D: Is everything okay?
C: THERESA
D: It’s fine. But, keep opening. Otherwise we will be here till next week.

E: CONT’D
D: Boys, stay with your sister.
N: 90 INT. KITCHEN 90 Oscar walks in followed by Isabel, then Theresa. Theresa closes the door and makes sure it’s shut. Isabel and Oscar look at each other. So much weight between them.
C: OSCAR
D: What do you want?
N: She lets out a shocked laugh.
C: ISABEL
E: choking up
D: I want to know why my daughter is in the other room.
N: He looks at her with a mixture of fear and contempt, then turns away.
C: ISABEL
E: CONT’D
D: How do you live with yourself?
N: He’s stunned into silence, then regains his footing.
C: OSCAR
D: A lot more easily than if I had left her for someone else to raise!
C: ISABEL
D: How did it even happen? We decided we couldn’t keep a baby.
C: OSCAR
D: No, you decided.
N: Theresa watches.
C: ISABEL
D: You agreed!
C: OSCAR
D: I was... a kid!
C: ISABEL
D: Exactly! We... WE gave her up for adoption. Because we decided that was best for her.
N: Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 55. A long moment where no one knows what to say. Theresa tries to calm things.
C: THERESA
D: Isabel, we tried to find you.
C: ISABEL
D: You have all the money in the world, you could have sent an army looking for me. You didn’t want to find me. You liked being the hero.
C: OCSAR
D: Don’t you talk to her like that! You didn’t want to be found. You ran the second they let you out of the hospital.
C: ISABEL
D: You’re god damn right I did! You know how painful that decision was to make. You were there.
C: OSCAR
D: I don’t remember it being hard for you at all. And if it was, you didn’t tell me. You just shut down. You were a fucking zombie.
C: ISABEL
D: So that gave you the right to take her and raise her behind my back... Because I was conflicted about being a mother when I was 18?
C: OSCAR
D: Conflicted? You were fucking crazy! One second telling me we were going to have some great life, the next that you were going to kill yourself.
C: ISABEL
E: screaming
D: I never said that.
C: OSCAR
D: Yes you did! YOU DID!
N: They are screaming. Theresa steps in.
C: THERESA
D: Okay, okay, calm down.
N: Isabel tries to collect herself. She looks at Oscar. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 56.
C: ISABEL
D: Why didn’t you just tell me you were going to keep her?
N: Oscar takes a moment and composes himself.
C: OSCAR
D: I didn’t know until you left. And by then I couldn’t find you.
N: He shakes his head.
C: OSCAR
E: CONT’D
D: I’m not going to justify it to you. I don’t owe you anything.
N: She can’t believe this.
C: ISABEL
D: Owe? Isn’t this your daughter we’re talking about? Doesn’t she deserve to know her mother?
N: Oscar is shaking his head.
C: OSCAR
D: You chose that. Not me.
N: Isabel looks at him nakedly.
C: ISABEL
D: Where did she think I was?
N: Oscar stares back.
C: OCSAR
D: You can’t suddenly just show up...
N: She takes a deep breath.
C: ISABEL
D: What do you expect me to do now? Turn my back?
N: Oscar looks at her, as if to say ‘if the shoe fits’.
C: ISABEL
E: CONT’D
E: Screaming
D: Do not fucking judge me!
N: Isabel gathers herself. She nods. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 57.
C: ISABEL
E: CONT’D

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 92 Grace and Jonathan have been opening gifts with the twins, and haven’t heard the yelling. They watch as Isabel opens the front door and exits without a look or a good-bye.

THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY 93 Isabel walks down the driveway toward her NYC taxi that has been waiting for her this whole time. 94 INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 94 At the window, Jonathan watches Isabel go. Behind him Grace looks confused. 95 INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER 95 A tearful, shocked Grace, sits opposite her father who tries to hold her hand. She pulls it away. She looks to Theresa to see if it’s true. Theresa’s face tells her it is. On each of their faces. Theresa takes a deep breath. Grace runs out. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 58. 96 EXT./INT. OSCAR’S STUDIO - NIGHT 96 The doors are open. Oscar sits alone smoking a cigarette, as he stares back at the house. A few rooms illuminated. On a work table sits a pile of old drawings. Seems to be an series of charcoal lines intertwining. All the sketches have the same theme, though the specifics and materials used vary. QUICK FLASH - NIGHT Feet intertwined on a beach. Reflected flicker of a camp fire. BACK TO PRESENT After another moment, Oscar puts out the cigarette, reaches down and pulls the extension cord apart. The barn goes dark. 97 INT. GRACE AND JONATHAN’S NYC APARTMENT - NEXT DAY 97 Oscar is in the middle of a fight with Grace.
C: OSCAR *
D: I considered everything and I did what I * thought was best for you. It never * occurred to me it wasn’t the right * decision. *
N: Grace is angry. *
C: GRACE
D: How could what’s best for me be to not know the woman who gave birth to me?
N: These are hard questions for Oscar to answer.
C: OSCAR

C: OSCAR
E: a deep breath
D: Don’t curse at me! I didn’t know what I was doing. I did my best. The story just developed. You think I did everything on purpose?
N: Grace looks at him, still angry.
C: OSCAR
E: CONT'D
D: I didn’t want you to know that she gave you up. So I told you she had died. Can you not understand that? I didn’t want you to have the hurt - that self doubt.
N: She looks at her father, emotionally.
C: GRACE
D: And you think I don’t feel that anyway? You think I don’t feel... incomplete? *
N: He looks at her, trying to process. *

C: THERESA
D: What were you doing in my closet?
C: OSCAR

N: The two others hang awkwardly in the background.
C: THERESA
D: You don’t need to fix everything. You’re not the fucking handyman!

C: ISABEL
D: You knew who I was when you invited me here, didn’t you?

D: You two are perfect for each other.
N: He’s totally taken aback.
C: OSCAR
D: What the hell does that mean?
C: THERESA
D: It means she didn’t seem that grateful either.
N: This hits him hard. He takes a beat. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 77.
C: OSCAR
D: I’m going to assume that’s the vodka talking.
C: THERESA

N: She blows up.
C: THERESA

N: Isabel stiffens.
C: ISABEL
D: I have to get home. I can’t stay.
C: THERESA
D: I know, I understand. But I the circumstances have changed. You’ve convinced me that this is too important to just be a one off donation. And, it means a lot to me that you're Grace’s biological mother.

N: Isabel looks at her and shakes her head. Give a little laugh.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
E: pause
D: I know, I don’t like it either. * * Look, I’m not going to be here this * weekend. I’m taking the boys to my * sister’s in DC for the weekend. Go see them while I’m gone. I’m sure you have a lot to talk about.

C: THERESA
E: CONT'D
D: Besides, ‘they talk to you in the car.’
N: He smiles. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 81.

THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE 151 We see a series of shots around the grounds and inside the house. Most of them are either nature: A deer drinking out of the pool - or inanimate objects in the house that having meaning to the make-up of their lives. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 113. A book on the table with the ring of a coffee cup on it. In Oscar’s studio, the huge stone, waiting. Pieces of the architecture of the house. The boys clothes in the hamper. 152 INT. THERESA CLOSET - EVENING 152 Close on the birds nest with the broken eggs that have been glued. We can see the cracks. Past the nest, we focus on Theresa’s dressing table where she sits, looking in the mirror. She wears a beautiful dress and is made-up. After a moment Oscar appears, dressed nicely, looking handsome, holding a glass of water which he sets down for Theresa. She takes a couple pills, not having to hide it any more. Oscar pulls reading glasses out of his pocket and kneels down next to her, facing her profile and holds out his hand. She hands him the earrings she’s having trouble with.
C: THERESA

C: THERESA
D: A dance party! Oh good! I love to dance!

N: CUT TO: 157 OVERLAP ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’ BEING SUNG 157 Oscar carries out a cake that looks more like a sculpture. Clearly his brainchild. He sets it down as everyone finishes singing happy birthday. Theresa looks embarrassed by the show of affection. She looks at the crazy cake. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 116. Takes a deep breath and blows out the candles. It takes a couple tries. People clap. Theresa looks at Oscar and shakes her head, as if to say, “I hate/love that you did this”. He takes some icing on his finger and offers it to her. Theresa shakes her head but eats it. A deep breath and she stands.
C: THERESA
D: Okay, okay...
N: Everyone claps.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
D: Thank you, thank you very much. Just to be clear, my birthday is not until next month and 52 is not exactly a landmark birthday, but thank you for being here and for this cake which is clearly a creation of my husbands fertile imagination.
N: She gazes at him.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
E: to the crowd
D: I think you all know that he’s a brilliant artist. You see his work all over our office.
N: People laugh. Theresa refocuses.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
E: a moment
D: I had always thought of artists as flaky and impractical. So you can imagine my surprise when I fell in love with one. I thought I was going to marry a nice banker.
N: A big laugh.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
D: But thank goodness there are no nice bankers.
N: More laughter. Theresa looks down at Oscar. A long pause. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 117.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
D: Do you know what he said to me in the car on the way here?
N: He takes a deep breath. She turns back to the crowd and quotes him.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
D: ‘Is it us moving through the world, or the world running past us?’
N: Some sounds of acknowledgement from the group. She’s very emotional but pushes it back.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
D: To which I replied, “Let’s not take the Northern State, traffic is horrible this time of day”
N: Lots of laughter. She looks at Oscar and mouths “I love you”. He takes her hand and kisses it. Theresa gathers and switches back to business mode.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D
D: But this is not about me, it’s not about my family. This is about us and our company and what we’ve accomplished. Together. I know that many of you are wondering what our company is going to look like after the sale.
N: She makes brief eye contact with Grace who sits listening next to Isabel. Theresa turns away and addresses the other guests.
C: THERESA
E: CONT'D
D: I’d be lying if I didn’t acknowledge that there will be a period of transition. But I must stress how important it was for me to find a partner who would not just continue our culture, but add to it. Making it more dynamic, with more resources, greater reach. So if you ask yourself do I feel uncomfortable and the answer is yes, then GOOD, cause that kind of discomfort leads to growth. That kind of discomfort makes you challenge yourself, that kind of discomfort is transformative...
N: Oscar looks down at Grace and Isabel. MUSIC OVERLAPS - “Brick House”, by the Commodores. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 118. 158 LATER IN THE EVENING 158 Tables and chairs have been moved and a dance party has broken out. Pure abandon, as everyone dances. Oscar and Theresa let loose. 159 INT.

N: Oscar is pained. Theresa can’t believe her own words.
C: THERESA
E: CONT’D

D: I know, baby, I know...
N: He holds her as she screams and sobs.
C: OSCAR
E: CONT’D
D: I’m with you. I’m with you...
N: They sob together. 160 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 160 The wind blows in the trees. A small animal listens for danger. Rain begins. TOLLING OF A BELL. 161 EXT. WOODS, NEAR HOUSE - DAY 161 On feet walking. Nature sounds. Wider to see Oscar, Isabel, Grace, and the boys walk in the woods together, holding a box of Theresa’s ashes. They stop in a clearing and open the box. Oscar turns the box over and the ashes blow. They all watch as the ashes disappear into the air and the earth. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 121. Isabel leans down and helps one of the twins zip up his sweatshirt. The camera moves past them to find Oscar’s sculpture sitting in the woods. He has shaped and intertwined the stone he was working on with part of the fallen tree and it stands quietly amongst the forest. A memorial. FADE DOWN/FADE UP 162 EXT. INDIA, CROWDED STREET - DAY 162 A cab honks its way through traffic. Isabel is in the back. She looks out. 163 EXT. ORPHANAGE - AFTERNOON 163 Isabel gets out of the cab in front of the orphanage.

Isabel smiles. 164 INT. ISABEL’S OLD ROOM, INDIA - LATER 164 She goes through the few belongings she has. Not a lot. Remnants from another life. She divides it in a ‘to keep’ pile, and a ‘throw away’. She hears some voices of children who are returning from their errands. Footsteps, then Jai appears in the doorway.
C: JAI
D: Miss Isabel!
N: She smiles wide. Opens her arms. Jai runs into them. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BF7 121A.

C: ISABEL
E: CONT’D

C: ISABEL
E: CONT’D
D: We could come back here and visit as much as you want.
C: JAI

N: Isabel’s face falls for a moment. Not what she was expecting.
C: JAI
E: CONT’D
D: I would miss my friends.
N: Isabel nods. She wants to make sure he understands.
C: ISABEL
D: The thing is, I have to live there. So we won’t see each other as much.
N: Jai thinks it over for a moment.
C: JAI
D: You can come and visit.
N: She thinks, then nods.

ON HER FACE as she gathers herself emotionally. Something across the room catches her eye. It’s a little mirror she kept over her wash basin. She sees herself in the reflection. Lets herself look. It’s one of those naked moments, where you can really see yourself. 167 EXT. ORPHANAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 167 A game is being played on the soccer field. Jai runs after the ball. Isabel appears on the periphery of the field and watches. As she does, we rise up and up; bird’s point of view. SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK.
