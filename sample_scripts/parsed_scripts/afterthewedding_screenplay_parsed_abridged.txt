THERESA=>I think people seemed to have a good time, don’t you think?
OSCAR=>Why’d you do it?
THERESA=>God, I didn’t know. I didn’t know it was her.
ISABEL=>Hello...
HOUSEKEEPING=>Hi Ms. Andersen. We are calling to check to see if you need more towels, or new linens?
ISABEL=>No.
DRIVER=>White girl. Very tan. Hot. Probably likes to have sex all night. Late 30’s? Who knows? I can’t tell the difference with white girls.
DRIVER=>You want to hear some music?
ISABEL=>No, I prefer it quiet.
JONATHAN=>It’s a blanket...?
GRACE=>No, I think it’s a table cloth.
JONATHAN=>Maybe it’s a cape.
OSCAR=>I think it might be the confederate flag.
THERESA=>I think it’s one of our lawyers...
OSCAR=>Who you should order a background check on.
THERESA=>Come in.
THERESA=>Wait here.
THERESA=>We have a visitor.
GRACE=>Oh hi.
GRACE=>Isabel, right?
GRACE=>Thanks for coming yesterday.
ISABEL=>Of course. Thank you for having me.
OSCAR=>I was going to call you.
ISABEL=>But you didn’t.
THERESA=>Would you like something to drink?
ISABEL=>No.
THERESA=>Why don’t we show you around?
JONATHAN=>Is everything okay?
THERESA=>It’s fine. But, keep opening. Otherwise we will be here till next week.
THERESA=>Boys, stay with your sister.
OSCAR=>What do you want?
ISABEL=>I want to know why my daughter is in the other room.
ISABEL=>How do you live with yourself?
OSCAR=>A lot more easily than if I had left her for someone else to raise!
ISABEL=>How did it even happen? We decided we couldn’t keep a baby.
OSCAR=>No, you decided.
ISABEL=>You agreed!
OSCAR=>I was... a kid!
ISABEL=>Exactly! We... WE gave her up for adoption. Because we decided that was best for her.
THERESA=>Isabel, we tried to find you.
ISABEL=>You have all the money in the world, you could have sent an army looking for me. You didn’t want to find me. You liked being the hero.
OCSAR=>Don’t you talk to her like that! You didn’t want to be found. You ran the second they let you out of the hospital.
ISABEL=>You’re god damn right I did! You know how painful that decision was to make. You were there.
OSCAR=>I don’t remember it being hard for you at all. And if it was, you didn’t tell me. You just shut down. You were a fucking zombie.
ISABEL=>So that gave you the right to take her and raise her behind my back... Because I was conflicted about being a mother when I was 18?
OSCAR=>Conflicted? You were fucking crazy! One second telling me we were going to have some great life, the next that you were going to kill yourself.
ISABEL=>I never said that.
OSCAR=>Yes you did! YOU DID!
THERESA=>Okay, okay, calm down.
ISABEL=>Why didn’t you just tell me you were going to keep her?
OSCAR=>I didn’t know until you left. And by then I couldn’t find you.
OSCAR=>I’m not going to justify it to you. I don’t owe you anything.
ISABEL=>Owe? Isn’t this your daughter we’re talking about? Doesn’t she deserve to know her mother?
OSCAR=>You chose that. Not me.
ISABEL=>Where did she think I was?
OCSAR=>You can’t suddenly just show up...
ISABEL=>What do you expect me to do now? Turn my back?
ISABEL=>Do not fucking judge me!
ISABEL=>You tell her, or I will.
OSCAR *=>I considered everything and I did what I * thought was best for you. It never * occurred to me it wasn’t the right * decision. *
GRACE=>How could what’s best for me be to not know the woman who gave birth to me?
OSCAR=>It wasn’t simple. *
GRACE=>Seems like it would be simple. Like you’ve always told me: “Tell the truth, that way you don’t have to remember anything”.
OSCAR=>I can’t believe this is happening. *
GRACE=>Now that sounds like the truth. *
GRACE=>What hotel is she staying in?
OSCAR=>Grace you don’t understand. At every moment, I made the best decision I could. But it was very complicated.
GRACE=>You’re fucking right! I don’t understand.
OSCAR=>Don’t curse at me! I didn’t know what I was doing. I did my best. The story just developed. You think I did everything on purpose?
OSCAR=>I didn’t want you to know that she gave you up. So I told you she had died. Can you not understand that? I didn’t want you to have the hurt - that self doubt.
GRACE=>And you think I don’t feel that anyway? You think I don’t feel... incomplete? *
GRACE=>You had no right to do what you did. And it’s not my job to make you feel better about it. And I won’t. *
GRACE=>What hotel?
JONATHAN=>Hi.
JONATHAN=>You sure you want to do this? I mean, you already have a really great mother.
JONATHAN=>Grace, I just mean...
JONATHAN=>I’ll wait for you.
ISABEL=>Hi.
GRACE=>Hi.
ISABEL=>Come in.
GRACE=>It’s a nice room.
ISABEL=>It’s very big.
GRACE=>I didn’t know you existed.
GRACE=>I’m sorry.
ISABEL=>You have nothing to be sorry about. You’re the only one.
ISABEL=>Would you like something to drink? We have... well, everything.
GRACE=>Wow. Um. I’ll have, that.
GRACE=>My dad said you were dead.
ISABEL=>I’m not.
ISABEL=>You want a glass?
GRACE=>Sure.
ISABEL=>What’s it taste like?
GRACE=>Fancy orange soda, I guess.
GRACE=>Have a sip.
ISABEL=>Sweet.
GRACE=>You don’t have this in India?
ISABEL=>We have ‘Artos’. Not so much at the orphanage, though.
GRACE=>I have so many questions.
ISABEL=>I don’t know how good I’ll be at answering them.
GRACE=>How long are you staying? Do you have time to meet?
ISABEL=>Yes. I’d like that.
GRACE=>I could call... Now, that I know you exist.
ISABEL=>Or I could call you. If you want.
GRACE=>Okay, yes. Great. Let me give you my number.
GRACE=>Do you have a phone?
GRACE=>I should go. Jonathan is waiting for me.
ISABEL=>I want you to help teach the meditation class while I’m away. You need to show the others how it’s done.
ISABEL=>Close your eyes.
ISABEL=>They are not closed. They are looking inside you. And only you get to see that.
JAI=>I see darkness.
ISABEL=>No, really look. And you can see all the people you love, everything your imagination can create. And you hear that?
ISABEL=>The drum? Boom boom... boom boom. Boom boom.
JAI=>That is not a drum.
ISABEL=>What is it then?
JAI=>My heart.
GRACE=>I thought it might remind you of home. It was probably stupid.
ISABEL=>No, it was thoughtful.
GRACE=>Jonathan took me here on one of our first dates. It seemed exotic then.
ISABEL=>You two seem happy together.
GRACE=>To tell you the truth, it’s kind of hard to think straight about anything right now.
ISABEL=>I get it.
GRACE=>Do I have any brothers or sisters I don’t know about?
ISABEL=>No. I mean, not exactly.
ISABEL=>There is one boy at the orphanage who I’ve pretty much raised. We found him on the road when he was just 1. Abandoned.
GRACE=>How old is he now?
ISABEL=>8 next week. Jai.
GRACE=>“Jai’.
ISABEL=>He loves birds. And he wants to be a professional football player.
GRACE=>Soccer you mean?
GRACE=>I brought some pictures. If you want to see?
ISABEL=>I would love that.
GRACE=>That’s me... in the bath. I was 5 I think...
GRACE=>This was second grade.
ISABEL=>And who’s that?
GRACE=>That’s Lyle.
ISABEL=>Was he your boyfriend?
GRACE=>For a minute. But he dumped me when I got him out in dodgeball.
ISABEL=>Better off. No one likes a sore loser...
GRACE=>Dad said you were depressed.
GRACE=>And that you both drank too much.
ISABEL=>Probably. We were really young.
GRACE=>I don’t think I could give up a baby.
ISABEL=>Wasn’t in my plans either.
ISABEL=>But I knew I couldn’t take care of you.
ISABEL=>The best I could do was to bring you into the world.
ISABEL=>I’ve spent a long time living with that.
ISABEL=>I drew it myself and had them copy it.
GRACE=>Didn’t it hurt?
ISABEL=>Fuck, yes.
ISABEL=>But, it made me appreciate it more.
GRACE=>I’m getting one.
ISABEL=>I’m sure that would make your mother really happy.
GRACE=>Actually, Theresa has a tattoo.
ISABEL=>Oh yeah?
GRACE=>It’s for my dad. An ‘O’. Right here.
GRACE=>Does that make you feel weird?
ISABEL=>Weird?
GRACE=>Jealous?
ISABEL=>No.
GRACE=>Good.
ISABEL=>I want you to have this.
ISABEL=>Of course, you don’t have to wear it.
THERESA=>Cibele there was a nest in my closet. Did you movie it?
THERESA=>A birds nest with blue eggs. Did you move it?
CIBELE=>No. I didn’t see it.
OSCAR=>Tess. This is Jamey and Andre. I’m showing them the new pieces.
THERESA=>Did you take that from me?
OSCAR=>I... I saw it in your closet.
THERESA=>What were you doing in my closet?
OSCAR=>I saw it when I was replacing a bulb for you. It was starting to fall apart, so I thought I’d repair it for you.
THERESA=>You don’t need to fix everything. You’re not the fucking handyman!
OSCAR=>Sorry about that. The down side of working at home.
THERESA=>Oh good come sit down.
THERESA=>I’m celebrating. I have officially sold my company.
ISABEL=>No, thank you.
THERESA=>You don’t drink?
ISABEL=>Not in the middle of the day.
THERESA=>Not at the wedding either.
THERESA=>Oscar said you guys partied a lot. Is it cause of that?
ISABEL=>Why am I here?
RICHARD=>Just wanted to stop by to say congratulations.
EDDIE=>We heard you made out pretty well.
THERESA=>Is that a surprise? Now, I’m just a very rich employee.
THERESA=>This is my friend, Isabel. Richard - Eddie.
THERESA=>I’m about to donate a small fortune to the orphanage she runs in India.
RICHARD=>Wow, now I feel bad about myself.
THERESA=>It’s about time.
ISABEL=>I assumed after the other night...
THERESA=>Why? It makes more sense now. We’re practically family.
THERESA=>The sole. For both of us.
THERESA=>You’ll love it.
ISABEL=>Why are you doing this?
THERESA=>Just be grateful and try not to ruin it. *
ISABEL=>I just know when something sounds too * good to be true. *
THERESA=>The only thing you need to know is what you can do with the money.
THERESA=>It’s a good day for both of us.
THERESA=>It must have been strange seeing Oscar again.
THERESA=>Does he look different?
ISABEL=>I don’t remember.
THERESA=>Oh gimme a break. I mean, he is handsome now, but back then...
ISABEL=>You knew who I was when you invited me here, didn’t you?
THERESA=>No. I did not. All I knew was what my people told me; That there was a good charitable opportunity. The rest is fate.
ISABEL=>I don’t believe you.
THERESA=>Well, That doesn’t matter.
ISABEL=>What do you want?
THERESA=>The real answer?
ISABEL=>Yes.
THERESA=>I want to make money.
THERESA=>Grace said you two had dinner.
THERESA=>Good. I’m glad you’re spending time together.
GWEN=>I’m sorry to interrupt...
THERESA=>Then why are you?
GWEN=>You have a conference call. I was trying to text you but you weren’t picking up.
THERESA=>Who scheduled a call during lunch?
GWEN=>You asked me to.
THERESA=>Well, I’m not available to talk right now, so push the call.
GWEN=>You specially asked me to schedule it before London closed.
THERESA=>Jesus Christ! Do I work for you or do you work for me?!
THERESA=>Which one is it?!
GWEN=>I work for you.
THERESA=>Very good. That’s using your brain. Now go push the fucking call and if you can’t then don’t come in tomorrow.
OSCAR=>Hey.
OSCAR=>The office dropped these off.
OSCAR=>They also wanted to know if you were okay.
THERESA=>I decided to go ahead and finance Isabel’s orphanage.
THERESA=>Are you going to say anything?
OSCAR=>I’m sure she’s happy about that.
THERESA=>You two are perfect for each other.
OSCAR=>What the hell does that mean?
THERESA=>It means she didn’t seem that grateful either.
OSCAR=>I’m going to assume that’s the vodka talking.
THERESA=>Good solution. No responsibility that way.
OSCAR=>You think you’re the only one affected by this?
OSCAR=>Don’t go up to the boys room like this.
THERESA=>Don’t tell me what to do. Don’t tell me how to be a mother! It’s not like you’re the better parent. And I’m getting pretty sick of hearing that single dad story. You didn’t do it all on your own.
GWEN=>Follow me.
THERESA=>I want to apologize. I was awful. Hope I didn’t scare you.
THERESA=>Gwen, I need an extra fifteen minutes. Could you please tell them I’m going to be late?
THERESA=>I’ve decided to amend my offer. I’d like to make it more generous.
THERESA=>It’s going to require you stay a few more days while we get the details worked out.
ISABEL=>I have to get home. I can’t stay.
THERESA=>I know, I understand. But I the circumstances have changed. You’ve convinced me that this is too important to just be a one off donation. And, it means a lot to me that you're Grace’s biological mother.
THERESA=>So, I’ve talked to our lawyers about establishing a fund.
THERESA=>It would be in both your and Grace’s names, and you would run it together.
THERESA=>I was thinking 20 million over six years.
ISABEL=>What?
THERESA=>From the research I have, it could cover fifty thousand kids a year. Medication, shelter, education. Anything you’d need.
THERESA=>Including your local farming project.
ISABEL=>What are you getting out of this?
THERESA=>Wow. *
THERESA=>Stay. Stay a little. Get to know Grace better. Talk to Oscar. Go out dinner with them. Spend some time with them.
THERESA=>I know, I don’t like it either. * * Look, I’m not going to be here this * weekend. I’m taking the boys to my * sister’s in DC for the weekend. Go see them while I’m gone. I’m sure you have a lot to talk about.
THERESA=>Congratulations.
OSCAR=>C’mon, you can do it!
OSCAR=>My god, what are you bringing with you?!
THERESA=>You need a lot of footwear choices when you are going to so many museums.
TWINS=>No!!
THERESA=>I’m teasing. Maximum 3.
THERESA=>Now hop in, I don’t want to hit traffic.
OSCAR=>There are snacks in the back.
OSCAR=>Why don’t you take the train, you won’t have to worry about traffic... or crashing.
THERESA=>I’m a better driver than you. And I want to drive. It’s just DC.
THERESA=>Besides, ‘they talk to you in the car.’
OSCAR=>Sounds familiar.
THERESA=>See, I’m listening; even when you think I’m not.
OSCAR=>Say hi to your sister. And please be careful.
OSCAR=>I could come...
ISABEL=>Can we talk?
OSCAR=>About what?
ISABEL=>Your wife.
OSCAR=>Do you want a glass of water?
ISABEL=>Did you know that Theresa asked me to administer a fund?
OSCAR=>Well, that’s what you came here for, right?
ISABEL=>With Grace. We’d run it together.
ISABEL=>I don’t know if Grace even knows. Or if any of it’s even real. Frankly, I don’t really trust your wife.
OSCAR=>You don’t trust her? She offers you money to run a charity and you question her integrity?
ISABEL=>20 million dollars.
ISABEL=>Is it real?
OSCAR=>You don’t need to be poor to have good intentions. There are people with money and ideals.
ISABEL=>Oh really? That’s not what I remember you saying when I knew you.
OSCAR=>Well, I was an idiotic idealist and I * grew up. Did you?
ISABEL=>You don’t know me so don’t pretend you do.
OSCAR=>Grace is not going to India with you.
ISABEL=>You think you’re in charge of her?
ISABEL=>I hate to tell you, but she’ll do whatever she wants. We all do eventually.
ISABEL=>Theresa doesn’t care about the orphanage. She barely wanted to hear about it. She cares about business. So what does she want?
OSCAR=>Maybe to give Grace some direction?
OSCAR=>I don’t know.
OSCAR=>Seems to be a theme for me these days.
ISABEL=>Join the club.
ISABEL=>I looked up some of your work online.
OSCAR=>Yeah?
ISABEL=>It’s pretty terrible.
OSCAR=>I looked you up too.
ISABEL=>Really?
OSCAR=>Yeah. You sound very noble. At least on the internet.
ISABEL=>The orphanage is my best side.
OSCAR=>Can I make you a coffee?
ISABEL=>How do you choose it?
OSCAR=>I can’t really describe it.
ISABEL=>Can’t or don’t want to?
OSCAR *=>Both? *
ISABEL *=>Fair enough. *
OSCAR=>Certain rocks kind of glow. To me.
ISABEL=>Like an ‘Aura’?
OSCAR=>Maybe. *
ISABEL=>And those are the ones you take.
OSCAR=>Not right away. I leave them, and then I go back. And if they are still... lighting up... then I take them. I’ve got to be sure because they are heavy. *
ISABEL=>Is that what happened with her?
ISABEL=>Grace. She was lighting up?
ISABEL=>I thought you’d come looking for me.
OSCAR=>I thought you’d come back.
JONATHAN=>Is it too ass kissy to wear a tie?
GRACE=>For what?
JONATHAN=>My presentation. I’m pitching Pizza hut. I’m the lead on it. Pretty sure I told you.
GRACE=>A tie is nice.
GRACE=>But not the Harvard one.
JONATHAN=>Are you going to meet us at Nobu or wanna come by the office?
GRACE=>For what?
JONATHAN=>For dinner. With Ben and Xandy?
JONATHAN=>What are you doing?
JONATHAN=>Is that India?
GRACE=>I thought we could go.
JONATHAN=>When?
GRACE=>Maybe for our honeymoon. There are supposed to be great hotels.
JONATHAN=>We’re going to Costa Rica. I want to surf.
GRACE=>Maybe we can do both.
JONATHAN=>India is too far babe. And I can’t take that much time off work. We were just going to be gone for a week.
GRACE=>Well, maybe you can just come for a week I can stay longer.
JONATHAN=>We just got married babe. I want to be with you.
GRACE=>I know. But maybe I want to see India.
JONATHAN=>You want to be alone in India? You hate being alone.
GRACE=>I won’t be alone. I’ll see Isabel.
JONATHAN=>Yeah. I get it. I’m not stupid.
GRACE=>Why are you being so shitty?
JONATHAN=>Me? How do you think it feels to marry someone and then a week later have them turn into a different person.
GRACE=>Well, a few things have happened.
JONATHAN=>And is that fair to me?
GRACE=>So, you thought I would stay the same forever?
JONATHAN=>Jesus Christ, Grace. That’s not what I’m saying.
GRACE=>Then what are you saying?
JONATHAN=>You can’t change things now. She gave you up.
JAI=>Isabel...!
ISABEL=>Ok, but it’s our secret.
GRACE=>Is my father here?
WORKER=>He took a break.
GRACE=>Dad!
GRACE=>What are you doing out here?
OSCAR=>Gracie... I’m just... thinking.
GRACE=>I hate fighting with you.
OSCAR=>You think you’ll forgive me?
GRACE=>What’s my other option?
GRACE=>But I want to know everything.
OSCAR=>Of course, Bunny. *
GRACE=>Don’t call me that.
OSCAR=>OK. What should I call you?
GRACE=>How about my name.
OSCAR=>When you give a child up for adoption, you have a period of time to change your mind. 30 days. A “grace” period.
GRACE=>So, how long did it take for you to decide to come get me?
OSCAR=>29 days. Visiting every day.
OSCAR=>We had agreed once you were born we would both leave. She kept up her end of the bargain.
OSCAR=>And I meant to. But I thought; ‘I’ll just go see her for an hour.’ Then I couldn’t stop going. Staring at you, talking to you.
GRACE=>And they don’t have to contact the mom?
OSCAR=>A “Good faith effort”, they call it. Just sending a letter to the last known address. But she didn’t even have one and I knew they wouldn’t find her.
GRACE=>Did you marry mom for my sake? So I would have a mother?
OSCAR=>I knew she’d be a great mother; but I married her because I love her.
GRACE=>Do you?
OSCAR=>Yes.
GRACE=>So, Isabel was just a mistake?
OSCAR=>No, not a mistake. We were just... young. *
GRACE=>Then why didn’t you tell me about her?
OSCAR=>I wanted to forget.
GRACE=>Did you?
OSCAR=>No.
THERESA=>Go show daddy. And tell him we won them.
THEO=>Daddy, look what we won!
OSCAR=>Wow, those are huge! How did you win them?
THERESA=>We stopped at a lovely go-kart track off the highway that had a few carnival games.
OTTO=>And mom said the games were a waste of time so she bought them for us.
THERESA=>It really smelled like feet and hot dogs in there, and I wanted to beat the traffic.
THERESA=>Do you mind taking this is for me? I have to get to the office.
THERESA=>Boys, go in with daddy and take a bath.
OSCAR=>Theresa...
THERESA=>I should be back for dinner.
OSCAR=>I spoke to your doctor.
OSCAR=>You’ve known for 3 months?
THERESA=>What? He spoke to you? Our relationship is confidential. He’s not allowed to tell you anything. I could sue him!
OSCAR=>He thought I knew. He said you promised to tell me right after the wedding.
THERESA=>I don’t have time for this right now, I have to go.
OSCAR=>Theresa! We need to talk about it.
THERESA=>There’s nothing to talk about.
THERESA=>Get out, please.
THERESA=>Get out! Get out I have to go work!
OSCAR=>No. I’m not getting out. I’m your husband. I’m never getting out.
THERESA=>Don’t tell Grace and the boys.
OSCAR=>Baby...
THERESA=>Don’t tell them. Please.
OSCAR=>We will figure something out.
THERESA=>I have figured it out.
OSCAR=>There has got to be an experimental treatment; Something they are testing.
THERESA=>You think I haven’t looked into everything? There’s nothing I can do. Nothing that won’t just prolong it... and make it worse... And make it worse. I don’t want you all to see me that way I don’t want you to see me that way.
OSCAR=>So you expect me to do nothing.
THERESA=>We don’t get to choose!
THERESA=>Let me go.
THERESA=>Let me go!
JAI=>How long will you be away?
ISABEL=>Just a week.
JAI=>So you’ll be back for my birthday?
ISABEL=>I don’t miss birthday parties, Jai. There’s ice cream.
ISABEL=>Keep laughing. Your dress is coming next.
PREENA=>We’re going to do the ice cream now.
PREENA=>Isabel. You are doing something important. Call me as soon as you sign the contract.
ISABEL=>Tell him, “Subha janmadina”
PREENA=>Allah tomara mangala karuka
ISABEL=>There are a couple of points I don’t understand.
THERESA=>Oh, that just means if you and Grace can’t agree on how the funds are distributed, Oscar will be the tie breaking vote. I thought it would be better if it wasn’t me.
ISABEL=>Not that. This.
ISABEL=>It says I have to ‘reside’ in New York?
THERESA=>Yes. Your cost of living will be taken * care of.
ISABEL=>I can just come for board meetings, do the rest over Skype.
THERESA=>I’m afraid it’s a requirement.
ISABEL=>That makes no sense. Why?
THERESA=>I know you are used to running things at the Orphanage, but you aren’t familiar with what it takes to manage millions of dollars. So I would like you here. *
ISABEL=>6 months here and 6 there.
THERESA=>It’s non-negotiable.
THERESA=>And please don’t waste our time pretending you aren’t going to do it. *
ISABEL=>You think I give a shit about your money? *
THERESA *=>I do. *
ISABEL *=>You think I’m for sale? You can’t buy me. *
THERESA=>I don’t want to buy you. This is an * opportunity. *
ISABEL=>Bullshit! That’s what it says here.
THERESA=>Call it whatever you want. But think what you could do with the money; how many kids you could help.
THERESA=>I know you’d sell yourself for that.
ISABEL=>Fuck you, you don’t know me.
THERESA=>Actually I know all about you. 39 years old. Born in Troy, New York; raised by adoptive parents in Connecticut. Went to boarding school upstate, then Syracuse for a year before dropping out and joining the Peace Corps - where you met Oscar... You’re a good person; An * idealist, well intentioned. You are... * just like Grace.
ISABEL=>I have a life! *
THERESA=>Your life will be good here.
ISABEL=>You think because your rich I’m going to * get down on my knees and lick your * fucking asshole? *
THERESA=>You think that because you’re a do-gooder it makes up for the fact that you abandoned your child?
THERESA=>Isabel!
THERESA=>Isabel. Stop. Come back. I’m sorry.
ISABEL=>You are cruel! You think you’re so * important. You sell... nothing. And the * world decided that’s worth a lot! *
THERESA=>Listen to me. Listen. She’s our daughter. We share her. I’ve had her for the last 20 years, and now she needs you.
THERESA=>And Oscar needs you...
ISABEL=>You’re crazy.
THERESA=>No!
THERESA=>I’m sick. I’m sick. I’m dying.
THERESA *=>Help me! My boys are 8 years old... *
ISABEL=>What?
THERESA=>Do I have to be half way across the world to get your help! *
ISABEL=>I’ll be right down.
ISABEL=>Grace.
GRACE=>Can I talk to you?
ISABEL=>Yes, Of course. What is it?
GRACE=>I don’t think I want to be married anymore...
GRACE=>He says I’ve changed. That I don’t talk to him, or laugh at his jokes; or want to go out with our friends. His friends really.
GRACE=>And he’s a good person, but I look at him now... and... He doesn’t want to know me... I mean “Me”.
ISABEL=>Have you told your parents how you feel?
GRACE=>I can’t. They thought I was too young to get married. And they were right. I wish I wasn’t married.
GRACE=>Does everyone feel this way?
ISABEL=>I wouldn’t know.
GRACE=>Tell me what to do?
ISABEL=>Grace, I can’t do that.
GRACE=>Please... Everyone will hate me if I get divorced... But I don’t know if I can stay married.
ISABEL=>No one is going to hate you.
GRACE=>Yes, they will. I’m stupid... I shouldn’t have done it...
ISABEL=>It’s your life. You decide.
GRACE=>Like you did?
ISABEL=>Like we all do.
GRACE=>When you gave me up, were you doing what you wanted?
ISABEL=>It was more complicated than that.
GRACE=>Not to me.
GRACE=>Not to me! Did you think about what you were doing to ME??!
GRACE=>I’m sorry... I’m sorry.
ISABEL=>I’m sorry.
PREENA=>Hello?
ISABEL=>It’s Isabel.
PREENA=>Isabel, did we get the money?
ISABEL=>Yes.
PREENA=>This is a miracle. It’s a miracle!! Let me get Jai for you. We will celebrate!
ISABEL=>No. No. Not now.
PREENA=>What’s the matter?
ISABEL=>I’m not coming back. I’m staying in New York.
PREENA=>What do you mean? For how long.
ISABEL=>To live.
OSCAR=>Is she okay?
ISABEL=>She’s confused and upset. She thinks she made a mistake.
ISABEL=>Apparently, she doesn’t love him.
OSCAR=>And she came to you?
OSCAR=>What did you tell her?
ISABEL=>I told her... that it was her life.
OSCAR=>Thank you for letting her stay.
OSCAR=>Hey, there you are.
GRACE=>Do you hate me?
OSCAR=>Are you kidding?
ISABEL=>Sure, have some.
GRACE=>I’ll get some more.
GRACE=>Do you want some, Dad?
ISABEL=>And see if they have any pastries.
OSCAR=>She’s so sensitive.
ISABEL=>Where could she have gotten it?
OSCAR=>I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night.
ISABEL=>Oscar. You have to tell her about Theresa.
OSCAR=>She made me promise I wouldn’t.
ISABEL=>It doesn’t matter. She has to know.
OSCAR=>I don’t want to hurt her.
ISABEL=>Who?
GRACE=>They said they’d bring the pastries over.
GRACE=>Oh, I forgot the milk...
OSCAR=>It’s okay, baby.
LAWYER=>Sign here.
LAWYER=>Theresa. Your turn.
THERESA=>It’s official. I have a lot less money.
ISABEL=>You’re changing a lot of peoples lives.
THERESA=>I hope you can do everything you want with it.
GWEN=>Sorry to interrupt, but Grace is here.
THERESA=>Oh. I wasn’t expecting her.
THERESA=>Bring her in.
ISABEL=>Thank you all for your time.
THERESA=>Why don’t you stay?
ISABEL=>I don’t think she came to see me.
ISABEL=>You okay?
THERESA=>Gracie. I didn’t know you were coming in today. I would have cleared myself for lunch.
THERESA=>Did you see Isabel on the way out?
GRACE=>Why didn’t you tell me?
GRACE=>Why didn’t you tell me yourself?
GRACE=>You were lying; every minute you knew and didn’t tell me.
THERESA=>I’m sorry.
GRACE=>Everybody’s sorry!
THERESA=>I didn’t want to make you sad.
GRACE=>And you didn’t think I’d be sad If you just died one day?
THERESA=>No. I...
GRACE=>What?
THERESA=>I didn’t want anything to change. People act differently sometimes.
GRACE=>How would you know? You didn’t tell anyone!
THERESA=>Maybe I was wrong.
GRACE=>If I knew you were dying, I wouldn’t have spent my time doing other stuff.
THERESA=>Don’t cry sweet heart. Don’t. It’s okay, you’ll be okay.
GRACE=>I don’t want to be okay!
THERESA=>And Isabel will be with you...
GRACE=>I don’t care about Isabel! You’re my mom. I don’t want anyone but you. If you don’t tell me, I can’t say all the things I want to say...
GRACE=>I can’t tell you that... I love you... and I don’t want you to die.
THERESA=>I love you.
THERESA=>This pair always gives me trouble.
OSCAR=>I love being needed. Makes me horny.
OSCAR=>Almost...
OSCAR=>One more second...
THERESA=>A dance party! Oh good! I love to dance!
TWINS=>Mom, this is serious, get out of the way.
THERESA=>I didn’t know it was serious! I’m sorry.
THERESA=>Be good for Bellie.
TANYA=>There are not many people who have the * power and tenacity to will their vision into existence - And in the process to change the way our industry works. Not to mention employing over a thousand people, raising a family and, oh yeah, making a shit load of money.
TANYA=>I’ve known Theresa for 20 years now, so when she told me she was thinking of selling the company I said: ‘don’t I get a vote?’
TANYA=>To which she replied: “no”.
TANYA=>So why sell? When you’ve built this big, * thriving, behemoth of a company. Why? *
SCATTERD GUEST *=>Why? Why? *
TANYA *=>That’s what I asked. Why? *
TANYA *=>And she said because she likes beginnings * - and a little bit of hardship. When * things get to easy, she gets bored. We * bored her! *
TANYA *=>Theresa, congratulations. We love you - * We can’t wait to see what you do next. * And we’re sorry we bored you! *
TANYA=>To Theresa, for bringing us all together.
EVERYONE=>To Theresa.
THERESA=>Okay, okay...
THERESA=>Thank you, thank you very much. Just to be clear, my birthday is not until next month and 52 is not exactly a landmark birthday, but thank you for being here and for this cake which is clearly a creation of my husbands fertile imagination.
THERESA=>I think you all know that he’s a brilliant artist. You see his work all over our office.
THERESA=>I had always thought of artists as flaky and impractical. So you can imagine my surprise when I fell in love with one. I thought I was going to marry a nice banker.
THERESA=>But thank goodness there are no nice bankers.
THERESA=>Do you know what he said to me in the car on the way here?
THERESA=>‘Is it us moving through the world, or the world running past us?’
THERESA=>To which I replied, “Let’s not take the Northern State, traffic is horrible this time of day”
THERESA=>But this is not about me, it’s not about my family. This is about us and our company and what we’ve accomplished. Together. I know that many of you are wondering what our company is going to look like after the sale.
THERESA=>I’d be lying if I didn’t acknowledge that there will be a period of transition. But I must stress how important it was for me to find a partner who would not just continue our culture, but add to it. Making it more dynamic, with more resources, greater reach. So if you ask yourself do I feel uncomfortable and the answer is yes, then GOOD, cause that kind of discomfort leads to growth. That kind of discomfort makes you challenge yourself, that kind of discomfort is transformative...
OSCAR=>I meant to tell you, the school called to suggest that we split the boys into separate classes after winter break. They think it would be good for their confidence.
OSCAR=>I just worry about that one teacher, Janet... She seems a little melancholy for 3rd grade.
THERESA=>Why are you telling me this?
OSCAR=>Are you okay? Let me get you a painkiller.
THERESA=>I don’t want it.
THERESA=>I want to know why you are telling me this? About the boys.
OSCAR=>Because we have to decide...
THERESA=>We don’t need to decide anything anymore.
THERESA=>You need to decide on your own because I’m not going to be here.
THERESA=>I’m not going to be here.
THERESA=>Do you think you’ll be with Isabel when I’m gone?
OSCAR=>Stop.
THERESA=>I want to know...
OSCAR=>Theresa, I love you.
THERESA=>I don’t feel well.
THERESA=>Where will I go?
THERESA=>Where will I go?
OSCAR=>I don’t know.
THERESA=>I don’t want to die!
THERESA=>I’m not done! I’m not done!
OSCAR=>I know, baby, I know...
OSCAR=>I’m with you. I’m with you...
JAI=>Miss Isabel!
ISABEL=>I missed you.
JAI=>I missed you too.
JAI=>Look.
ISABEL=>Amazing.
JAI=>I have been up there.
ISABEL=>Really?
JAI=>Yes. Miss Preena brought a ladder. I watched the mother feed them.
ISABEL=>What does she feed them? Lentils?
ISABEL=>Vindaloo?
JAI=>No, Miss Isabel! Worms!
ISABEL=>Oh, yuck.
ISABEL=>Jai, I want to ask you something.
ISABEL=>I was wondering if you might like to come to New York with me?
ISABEL=>To live.
ISABEL=>We could come back here and visit as much as you want.
JAI=>But this is my home. I want to stay here.
JAI=>I would miss my friends.
ISABEL=>The thing is, I have to live there. So we won’t see each other as much.
JAI=>You can come and visit.
ISABEL=>I can.
ISABEL=>You want to go play?
ISABEL=>Okay, go.
