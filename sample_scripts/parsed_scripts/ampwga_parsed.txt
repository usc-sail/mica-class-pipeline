C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Frank always used to say: “Tell your story walking, pal...’
N: INT/EXT LIONEL CAR - HARLEM ST - DAY A beat up ‘54 Dodge sits on a cold Harlem street. Two guys in the front.
C: LIONEL CONT
E: V.O.
D: He was more philosophical than your average gumshoe, but he liked to do his talking on the move so... Here’s how it all went down.
N: Close on the TWO GUYS: LIONEL ESSROG and GILBERT CONEY. CONEY is a big lug in a porkpie hat. LIONEL medium build, wiry. Both late 30’s. They don’t look like P.I.’s but that’s what they are. Lionel sits shotgun. He’s a hypnotizing array of Tourettic twitches and tics.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: I got something wrong with my head, that’s the first thing to know
C: LIONEL
E: yelps
D: IF!
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: It’s like having glass in the brain. I can’t stop picking things apart, twisting em around, words and sounds especially. It’s like an itch that has to be scratched.
N: C.U. A LOOSE THREAD...hanging off the sleeve of a sweater. An arm and a wrist resting on a seated knee. The knee starts to jiggle and then...FINGERS pluck at the thread, try to snap it off then smooth it down.
C: CONEY
D: Quit pullin’ at it. You’re gonna make a fuckin’ mess outta things.
C: LIONEL
D: I got threads in my heads! I got threads in my HEADS! I GOT THREADS IN MY HEADS, MAN!
N: Pink Revisions 2. This is LIONEL. Words are the fuel for the boiling pressure- cooker of his obsessive-compulsive brain. CONEY ignores the outburst, used to it. He stuffs little White Castles in his mouth and watches Lionel, deadpan. Lionel’s head twitches.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: And I twitch a lot. It’s hard to miss. Makes me look like a goddam spastic but if I try to hold it back it just makes it worse.
N: He’s pulling it out further, more thread unravelling. A disaster...Lionel’s pulled a foot of thread off his cuff before Coney reaches for his pocketknife...
C: CONEY
E: cuts it off
D: Like I said, a fucking mess. Jesus, freakshow. Ruin another sweater.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Fucking mess is right. The nuns said my soul wasn’t at peace with God and I should do penance. Frank said anyone teaching God’s love while they hit you with a stick should be ignored on every subject.
N: Lionel’s eyes are down the street, watchful and sharp. Black kids playing football in the cold. LIONEL’s POV: way off down the block a figure approaching. Lionel: sharpens up. A flicker of a grin.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Frank Minna. If you had to pick just one guy to be on your side, he’s the one you’d want. It’s Minna’s game. We’re all just in the lineup.
N: TAP TAP TAP... at the window. A trim black trench-coat. A smiling face under a cool hat , upturned collar against the cold. Now that’s what a P.I. looks like and this one is: FRANK MINNA. Lionel rolls the window down.
C: MINNA
D: Boys.
C: CONEY
D: Boss.
N: Pink Revisions 3.
C: LIONEL
D: Heya, Frank. FRANKLY FRANKADY FRANKO!
N: Lionel reaches out and taps Minna twice on the shoulder. An affectionate compulsion. Frank doesn’t even notice it anymore. He lights a cigarette.
C: MINNA
E: hands him a number
D: Okay listen...here’s the shot... I’ll be third floor. Lionel go to the payphone on the corner in 20 minutes. When they come.. probably three or four of em...when they come, you call me here... I’ll buzz em in. Coney waits on the door, I buzz him in and he stays right inside. Lionel’s listening sharp on the line. If you hear me say “Then we have a problem” hustle over, Coney lets you in, two of you come upstairs and back me up quick, okay?
C: CONEY
D: What’s going down here, Frank?
C: MINNA
E: pause
D: I gotta keep this one under my hat, boys.
C: LIONEL
D: Fat cats in HATS!
C: MINNA
D: Them’s the ones, pal. Let’s catch a big score and get outta this game, get fat ourselves.
N: He winks at Lionel. Lionel notices a little sweat on Minna’s brow despite the cold.
C: CONEY
D: Boss, we’re not carrying.
C: MINNA
D: What?
C: CONEY
D: A piece. I don’t have a piece.
N: Pink Revisions 4.
C: MINNA
D: A piece? Say ‘gun’, Gilbert.
C: CONEY
D: I got no gun.
C: MINNA
D: That’s what I count on. That’s how I sleep at night, you with no gun. I’ve got a gun. You just show up. I wouldn’t want you chuckleheads coming up a stairway for me with a hairpin. With a harmonica.
C: LIONEL
D: Hairy chin. Harmony harp. Don’t wind me up.
C: MINNA
E: smiling at Lionel
D: With an unlit cigar. With a fucking chicken wing. Right, Brooklyn?
C: LIONEL
E: grins
D: Chicky wing ding! Quit winding me up! You’ll throw me off. Just give us the rest of it.
C: MINNA
D: Right. Now, if I say “Lemme use the can.” it means we’re coming out. Get Gil, get in the car and get ready to follow. And stay tight, I might need to give someone the slip, got it?
C: LIONEL
D: ‘Problem’- up the stairs, ‘use the can’- start the car. Got it. Get, gotten, got, GOTCHA!
C: MINNA
D: Lionel’s got it. Just follow his lead.
C: CONEY
E: protesting
D: You gotta be kidding me...
N: Pink Revisions 5.
C: MINNA
D: Coney what did I say when I came into the office last Tuesday?
C: CONEY
D: Huh?
C: MINNA
D: Lionel?
C: LIONEL
E: rapid fire
D: Took your coat off, put your hat on the 3rd hook, said “I just stood next to a girl on the ferry and the smile she gave me will get me through this winter” Threw Danny your notebook. “How’s a guy supposed to keep a marriage together when 22 is on the menu?”
C: MINNA
E: nods
D: Like I said, Lionel’s on point.
N: And he heads across the street
C: LIONEL
D: Sit on it, Bailey! IF!
N: INT/EXT SAME CAR - 20 MINUTES LATER Coney is reading the paper, Lionel is locked on the street and the door. Lionel is carefully folding a stick of gum exactly in half before putting it in his mouth.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Fucking Bailey. Bailey is what my head calls me. It calls me out if I try to resist it. There’s things that calm it down: gum, weed, sometimes something stronger if I’m in bad shape. But if I try to put a lid on it it gets worse. If I get nervous it gets worse. If I get excited it gets worse. It’s the argument I can’t win.
N: The kids playing thump a football against Coney’s door. Pink Revisions 6.
C: CONEY
E: grumbling
D: Hey, watch it! Another Minna Classic. Freezin’ our asses off, don’t even know the score.
C: LIONEL
D: What you got big plans this weekend, Coney? Coney Island! Coney Island hot dogs! Get your Coney Island hot dogs right here!!
C: CONEY
D: Alright, Freakshow, just a little quieter please...
N: Lionel looks at his watch. Second hand hits the 12 and he hits Coney in the arm. LIONEL (cont’d) We’re on. Get ready. Lionel hops out of the car and heads for a payphone. INT. HARLEM APT/EXT HARLEM ST/PAYPHONE (INTERCUT) - DAY C.U.: A PHONE, ringing on top of a dresser... MINNA’S HAND reaches in and picks it up and off the screen.
C: MINNA
D: Yeah.
C: LIONEL
E: muted
D: Hey, boss. Boss, bossy, BITCH!
C: MINNA
D: You keeping it together, Brooklyn?
C: LIONEL
D: Yeah...it’s under control. I got my gum. I got ya covered.
C: MINNA
D: I know it. Okay, like we said, stay tuned in, pal. I’m might need that head of yours later.
N: LIONEL SEES: TWO BIG BLACK CARS PULL UP DOWN THE STREET Pink Revisions 7. Two men get out of each and converge on the sidewalk in front of the building. One of them is A GIANT MAN IN A DARK COAT...easily 7’0”.
C: LIONEL
D: Hey. I think your friends are here.
N: In the apartment A DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) (reacting to the GIANT) Jesus look at the size of that guy. They got serious muscle with em...Everything cool, Boss?
C: MINNA
D: Cool as can be. Just a little chat.
N: CLOSE ON: THE DRESSER as Minna opens the top drawer and puts the phone down inside with the receiver still off the cradle. LEAVES THE DRAWER OPEN A CRACK so Lionel can listen in... ON LIONEL: Looking over to...THE DOOR. The four guys get buzzed in.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: ‘Here Lies Frank Minna. Cool as can be.’ They’ll carve that on his fucking tombstone. I don’t know if it was growing up in Greenpoint or fighting the Japanese, but he was cool under pressure in a way you can’t teach.
N: LIONEL leans out and waves to CONEY who hustles out of the car and to the door, buzzes, enters, gives thumbs up.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: I was just happy to have job on his team. And if there’s one thing my pain in the ass brain does know how to do...it’s listen and remember things.
N: Lionel folds up a handkerchief and rubber bands it to the phone mouthpiece. He closes his eyes to focus and listen. (We see the meeting in the apartment AS IMAGINED BY LIONEL, and the action on the street around him and over all this there’s NO SOUND but what Lionel hears through that phone receiver in the dresser.) Pink Revisions 8. Muffled and broken, HE HEARS: FOOTSTEPS and a DOOR OPEN MINNA (cont’d) Gentlemen...thanks for coming. CU -- Ice dropping in a glass just above the phone. MINNA (cont’d) (CONT’D) Drink?
C: LOU
D: When I want a drink I’ll find a bar and a blonde, now explain this crap.
N: SOUND -- a FILE SLAPPING DOWN ON A TABLE LIONEL’S POV: Kids playing on the street.
C: MINNA
D: Well, which part didn’t you understand?
C: LOU
D: How about the part where you got the idea to go poke around after some colored broad for starters.
N: CU: Lionel mouths ‘colored broad’ silently to himself then--
C: LIONEL
E: into his sleeve
D: Cold wig on a rod !
C: MINNA
D: She works for the committee.
C: LOU
D: She’s a fucking secretary. We told you to dig on Horowitz...find something we can shut them down with.
N: CU: Lionel mouths “Horowitz”
C: MINNA
E: silence
D: There’s nothing there. Unless you’re dumb enough to try to wave that old Red flag of yours one more time. Yeah, right.
N: Pink Revisions 9.
C: MINNA
E: CONT'D
D: So, if you want to know what’s going in that report, that ‘colored broad’ is doing most of the legwork on Hamilton for ‘em. And what she’s sniffing around I’m sure is of concern to you gentlemen, so I put some time into that too.
N: CU: Lionel mouths ‘Hamilton report’
C: LIEBERMAN
D: You looked in some funny places.
C: MINNA
D: What can I tell ya? I’m a snoop, that’s what I do. It’s called being thorough, Lou.
C: LOU
D: It’s called wasting our time. This is fucking Chinese.
C: MINNA
D: If you need a road map to wipe your ass I can’t help you, Lou. These gentlemen understand it or they wouldn’t be here.
C: LIEBERMAN
E: quiet - the leader
D: Walk us through it, Mr. Minna, just to be sure we’re very clear.
C: MINNA
E: picks up something
D: It’s right here in ink, Mo---
N: A COP CAR POPS ITS SIREN TO CLEAR THE KIDS AND THEN SIRENS OUT ONTO THE AVENUE. LIONEL, clutches the phone to his chest, desperate to muffle the sound. An agonizing 10 seconds lost. Exasperated, LIONEL finally gets back on... MINNA (CONT’D) (cont’d) (CONT’D) ...anybody like to offer a different interpretation? A long silence. Pink Revisions 10.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: None of this can be proved.
C: MINNA
D: That signature is the real deal.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: If you knew the man, you’d know why that seems highly implausible to me.
C: MINNA
D: I checked it against others. It’s his John Hancock. And the paper trail backs it up. Lay that on top of the rest of what I’ve included here and I think we can all agree you’re sitting on a powder keg.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: And you think Horowitz knows all of this?
C: MINNA
D: Nope. Or you’d already be eating shit. It’ve been in the paper the next day.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: The girl: she married, got family?
C: MINNA
D: It’s all in my file...her mother’s dead. No brother or sisters.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: What about her father?
C: MINNA
E: laughs
D: Lou you’re Mr Straight Talk. Why don’t you go ask him and see what he says.
C: LOU
D: You think this is funny?
C: MINNA
D: No, Lou, just ironic. There’s a difference. Look it up. Father’s a busted up vet. He runs a jazz club up here. Drinks too much.
N: A pause. Pink Revisions 11.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: Mr Minna, I’ll assume you’re aware of what occurs a week from Thursday?
C: MINNA
D: I am.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: So then you understand our firm determination to keep such information out of the hands of our detractors?
C: MINNA
D: Sure. Nature of the game.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: These are all photos. May I hope you’re in possession of the originals?
C: MINNA
D: I am.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: Excellent. We’ll need to get those from you.
C: MINNA
D: I figured as much. I thought we might talk about terms.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: Terms?
C: MINNA
D: I think it’s fair to say that the initiative involved in securing these...assets...goes a good bit beyond the original scope of work in our arrangement.
C: LOU
D: ...the fuck are you talkin’?
C: MINNA
D: I’m thinking a bonus...for taking a wild card off the table before it got in the game.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: I see. And what do you have in mind?
N: Pink Revisions 12. A small sound -- a piece of paper being unfolded? Lionel can’t hear...he’s nervous. LIONEL’S POV: Cop car way down the street; a BLACK GUY (BILLY ROSE) walking by lights a smoke, looks across the street and moves on; Coney in the door
C: LOU
D: Have you lost your mind?
C: MINNA
D: Let’s not kid each other fellas. You got the biggest gravy train this century pulling out. I’m asking for a seat in the rear here.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: That’s quite impossible.
C: MINNA
D: I’d double this at any paper in town.
N: There is a sudden deadly silence. Lionel senses it.
C: LOU
D: I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say what you just said and we’re gonna-
C: MINNA
D: Just an observation. I’m here in good faith. Just assessing the value...
C: LOU
D: You can forget it--
C: MINNA
D: Jeez Lou, what’s your beef with a guy getting paid for good work? I mean you get paid for doing nothing as far as I can--- UHHNH!
N: A THUD. LIONEL FREEZES.
C: DEEP VOICE
E: GIANT
D: Watch it.
C: LOU
D: Are you fuckin’ packin’!?
N: Pink Revisions 13.
C: MINNA
E: winded
D: Jesus, take it easy...Had it since the war. Remember that thing some of us fought in?
N: A SCUFFLE
C: LIEBERMAN
D: Enough! Lou...a word...
N: It goes quiet...whispered conference that Lionel strains to hear.
C: MINNA
D: Oh come on fellas, don’t get in a twist, it’s just busi...
C: LIEBERMAN
E: evenly
D: Mr. Minna, we do appreciate the service you’ve rendered. These gentlemen will take you to get the originals and if all is in order we’ll arrange an appropriate resolution for you.
C: MINNA
E: accommodating
D: Sure, of course...like I said, good faith. Just lemme use the can first...
N: LIONEL hears the signal and goes into high gear. He hangs up the phone and turns to exit, then turns back and hangs it up again, then dashes out... EXT HARLEM STREET / INT LIONEL CAR - DAY ...and runs across street, signaling at CONEY in the door, who sees him coming, gets the message and hustles out and over to... THE CAR...

N: He starts to get out but Lionel stops him.
C: LIONEL
D: No. He said “lemme use the can” We’re supposed to follow him. CAN THE MAN!
N: They look across to...THE DOORWAY MINNA and the FOUR MEN come out. THE GIANT and MINNA move a step or two off while a SMALLER MAN (LOU) confers briefly with the other two, whose faces are obscured. LOU nods and they all split. The TWO MEN, still not clearly seen, turn and hurry off the opposite direction into a waiting car. The GIANT and LOU move Minna toward the front car. Minna looks okay...is he holding his side a little? He’s definitely being escorted to the car. He moves as if to turn toward them but THE GIANT takes him by the elbow and herds him forward. MINNA shakes off the guy’s hand. ON LIONEL AND CONEY
C: CONEY
D: I don’t like it...

But just as LIONEL gets within a few strides of it...

And now they can see the car up ahead, whipping under the bridge toward a dark turn ahead...

The driver of the BLACK CAR flashes something at the guard and THE CAR IS WAVED THROUGH.
C: LIONEL
D: Son of a bitch!
N: He goes back inside but they’re boxed in and being channeled into a booth. LIONEL hits CONEY in the arm. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) QUACKER! QUOTER! QUARTER!
C: CONEY

LIONEL sits slumped in a chair, his bloody coat, Frank’s hat and other stuff on the desk in front of him. Coney leans against the wall smoking a cigarette. TONY VERMONTE and DANNY FANTL sit on desks.

C: JULIA
D: Look, I just wanna be alone, okay?
C: LIONEL
D: Sure.
N: He flips Frank’s hat onto the side table and dumps out of it: a watch, a matchbook, some change, an address book, Frank’s wallet...
C: JULIA
D: Gimme the watch I guess. I don’t want all the rest of that stuff.
N: He hands it to her...
C: LIONEL
E: she nods
D: I’m gonna keep his gun, if that’s okay with you. You want his hat?
C: JULIA
D: What for? Is there money in that wallet?
N: Lionel takes the money out of the wallet to hand to her JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D) Jesus, it has blood on it, for chrissakes! I don’t wanna see that. Ain’t you got any sense? Emotion is rising in her...Lionel scoops up the cash and gun with the loose stuff and pockets what he can. He pauses on one item: Frank’s wedding ring. She takes it and turns it over and this actually gets her to tear up a little. She sits on the couch. JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D) Ah jeez...Was somebody with him anyway? When he...? Pink Revisions 31.

He hangs Minna’s hat up next to his on the wall... His weeping has turned into twitches and small shouts that seem to be building... A MIRROR reflects his bed. In it we see him sit only partly visible on the edge of the bed, get something out of a drawer (a small pipe) and then a match flares and we see him inhaling something. He sets it down and takes a photo off the side table PHOTO: Much younger and cooler looking Frank Minna with his arm around a young Lionel, skinny...both smiling. ON LIONEL: eyes glazing, he smiles a little and lets himself fall back onto the bed... INT. LIONEL’S DREAM/SWIMMING POOL As he hits the sheets they ripple TURNING INTO AMBER COLORED WATER.

INDOOR POOL - EARLY MORNING A HUGE PUBLIC INDOOR POOL of the kind they don’t build anymore. Stained glass, beautiful tile, etc. It’s early morning, dawn light cracking in, and the steam and the light dance on the water. A LONE FIGURE swims powerful laps. Back and forth without pause. A YOUNG AIDE in a suit sits on a bench in the shadows with a valise full of papers in his lap waiting. Pink Revisions 33. Finally the swimmer climbs straight up out of the water, his back to us. He’s powerfully built. A BLACK POOL ATTENDANT emerges out of the shadows to put a robe around him and the YOUNG AIDE in the suit hurries to catch up as THE MAN exits. EXT. PUBLIC ATHLETIC CLUB - MORNING A SMALL FLAG with an unfamiliar insignia decorates one corner of a BIG BLACK CAR’s hood. THE LICENSE PLATE reads “BA 1”. WIDE: by the doors of the MEN’s side of the public bathhouse. About a dozen people wait in the cold and spitting RAIN to be let in to swim.

MAYOR’S POV: the powerful figure strides out through the open double doors to the clerk’s desk in the hall where, without hesitation he swipes a form from a terrified clerk, bends to write on it hastily... The MAYOR looks at his men. ‘What do I do?’ but THE MAN IS CHARGING BACK ACROSS THE HALL STRAIGHT AT US Powerful strides bring him into full view for the first time as he bears down; tall and strong, jaw thrust out, flashing eyes and big hawkish nose, coming like a juggernaut until HE’S RIGHT ON US, SLAPPING THE FORM DOWN, FURIOUS

N: She weeps a little more...for Frank or for herself? Tony pats her back as Danny shoots Lionel a look. She gets herself together. JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D) Look I know the car service was mostly for the books but he never talked about how he ran the snoop work and I ain’t interested. So I’m putting Tony in charge.

E: CONT'D

N: Lionel shrugs and starts out again. DANNY (cont’d) (CONT’D) You know there’s that joint Formosa in mid-town. I tried to take Linda there to hear Chet Baker once. EXT. FORMOSA LOUNGE (MID-TOWN STREET) - DAY His car slides up on a club marquee. “THE FORMOSA”.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Frank didn’t have to cover for me, he just never put me out into situations that were going to punch my buttons. Talking to people, getting information out of em, that’s the bread and butter of the trade but never my strong suit...
N: INT. FORMOSA LOUNGE - DAY 50’s supper club. Classy. Lionel comes in and looks around. It’s afternoon empty. Latin guys setting the floor tables. There’s a HOSTESS cleaning up candles from tables
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: ...especially if a girl shows up in the mix. And in this line of work, they usually do.
N: BARTENDER comes over as Lionel eases onto a stool.
C: BARTENDER
D: Music’s at seven.
C: LIONEL
D: Can I get an early one? Whiskey ginger.
N: Bartender nods. Lionel pulls a bill and a matchbook out of his pocket, puts them on the bar. Takes Minna’s detective license out of his coat. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Say pal, you in here regular? Pink Revisions 46.
C: BARTENDER
D: Most of my life.
C: LIONEL
D: You know a guy named Minna? Frank. That’s him.
N: The bartender looks a beat. Shakes his head
C: BARTENDER
D: Everybody looks like everybody to me. But I don’t think so. She’s good with faces.
N: The HOSTESS slides up, overhearing, and indicates to let her see the photo. Studies it then shakes her head but takes in Lionel: kinda cute. She smiles, flirts.
C: HOSTESS
D: Nice face.
C: LIONEL
E: nervous
D: Nice yourself.
C: HOSTESS
D: Got a light?
N: Lionel opens the matchbook. Lights one and starts to hold it for her as she leans -- then blows it out.
C: HOSTESS
E: CONT’D
D: Ooh. You a tease?
N: He lights another one, blows it out as she leans again. Her eyebrows raise...
C: LIONEL
D: Sorry...
N: Fast now, lights a third, trying to keep it together. Compulsively blows it out.
C: HOSTESS
E: rolls her eyes
D: Jeez, forget I asked.
N: And she’s gone. Lionel doesn’t even sigh. This is his isolation and he’s used to it. The bartender is laughing though...
C: BARTENDER
D: You got something against blondes?
N: Pink Revisions 47.
C: LIONEL
D: Nah, it’s...it has to sound right or I can’t stop doing it.
N: He lights two more matches and on the last one he’s good.
C: BARTENDER
D: Must be inconvenient.
C: LIONEL
D: Buddy, you don’t know the half of it.
N: Starts to pocket the matches and change...
C: BARTENDER
D: That uptown shit’s the real deal, huh? You get up there much?
N: Lionel stops -- no idea what he’s talking about. The guy points at the matchbook BARTENDER (cont’d) (CONT’D) King Rooster. Lionel turns the matchbook over. A ROOSTER WITH A CROWN ON A RED BACKGROUND. LIONEL -- staring. Where’d he get this? Opens it. “B.A. - 2:30” written in a familiar hand. Realizes...It was in Minna’s pants.
C: LIONEL
D: I don’t know it.
C: BARTENDER
D: Jazz joint in Harlem. Lucky’s is a good time too but the all the guys playing Hard are at the Rooster.
N: LIONEL -- “a jazz club in Harlem”. He’s moving. INT. LIONEL’S CAR #2 / EXT. HARLEM SIDE STREET - DAY He drives along the block where Minna’s mysterious meeting took place. EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - DAY A RED NEON SIGN WITH THE CROWNED ROOSTER ON IT. Lionel pulls up. Pink Revisions 48. INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - DAY A small dark Harlem joint. Bar, tables and a little space for the band in a paneled corner that’s hardly even a stage. Black bartender setting up. THREE BLACK GUYS at a back table talking low. One with his back to the bar. LIONEL enters and quick looks check him out. One guy, 50’s very dark black skin, looks at Lionel in the mirror long and hard, watchful.
C: BARTENDER
D: We ain’t open yet.
C: LIONEL
D: Can I get an early one? I’m freezing here. Whiskey neat.
N: He slaps a bill up. The bartender’ll take that. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) (fishing) Say, you the manager?
C: BARTENDER
D: I look like the manager?
C: LIONEL
D: Who’s playing tonight?
C: BARTENDER
E: at the THREE GUYS
D: Hey, Billy...
N: The DARK-SKINNED GUY with his back to the bar looks over. Lionel meets eyes with him in the mirror behind the bar. BARTENDER (cont’d) (CONT’D) Who’s on tonight?
C: BILLY
D: Mr Big Shot.
N: His eyes locked on Lionel, he puts a cigarette in his mouth with his left hand and then using the same hand to snap open a lighter and light it...highlighting that his RIGHT ARM HANGS LIMP AND USELESS. Lionel still staring. Does he know that face?
C: BARTENDER

N: Pink Revisions 49.
C: BARTENDER
E: CONT'D
E: to Lionel re poster
D: You caught this cat? I seen cool. This brother rewriting cool.
N: He tries to make it seem like a sneeze. He’s getting excited and that winds up his tics. He’s got to get out. LIONEL (cont’d) Catch him another time. If!
C: BARTENDER
D: Don’t wait long. Them French girls keep loving him up he’s gonna move over there for good, you know what I’m saying?
C: LIONEL
D: French Kissing Cats! Thanks pal.
N: Lionel’s out the door and we CUT TO: INT. LIONEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT A RECORD SPINNING, a standard playing, sad but soothing. Camera pans over to find LIONEL in a chair by the radiator with a joint. His head is moving as though he can’t get a kink out of his neck. Or can’t shake his brain.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: On my average day the weed will handle my twitching and shouting but it makes my thinking fuzzy.
N: A CAT, comes over and climbs up in his lap. He pets her and this contact seems to calm him as he looks out the window at the lights on the street.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: In my dreams I’m calm and clear like I was when I was a kid. Even after my head started messing with me, my mother could settle it down. She’d sing soft songs and stroke the back of my neck and it would leave me for a while. We’d lie on the bed and talk about all of the places we were gonna go.
N: The sad trumpet carries us over into.... Pink Revisions 50. EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - MORNING It’s cold and clear. Lionel’s got a coffee. People are hustling for the subway. Lionel comes past a telephone pole close to camera, flicks his eyes at the flyers on it and EXITS... PIECES OF PAPER posted to the pole rustle in the cold... ...and Lionel comes back into frame, looking closer at one of the flyers, reading:
C: SAVE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS!
D: SAVE FT. GREENE! COME TO A PUBLIC HEARING ON PROPOSED HAMILTON HOUSING PLAN Sponsored by: Committee against Racial Discrimination in Housing
N: HAMILTON. COMMITTEE. Lionel takes it down and continues on to: INT. L&L OFFICE/ EXT. COFFEE SHOP PAYPHONE - MORNING Lionel enters Danny’s reading the paper. Tony’s on the phone, pissed...
C: TONY
D: Well, Christ, Coney, did you get the shot or not?...doing what?...Getting the paper ain’t worth shit! The fuck does that have to do with his back?... Bending over, my ass, we gotta have him lifting the lawnmower out the car or playing tennis or spinning around the room with some broad sittin’ up on his tentpole and his arms out wide. I don’t care so long as it involves his back!...I know he’s fakin’ all the time, that’s why he’s won three claims! Wait him out or set him up!... I know it’s cold, that’s why they call it winter!
N: He hangs up. Sees Lionel looking at him. That was his case. TONY (cont’d) (CONT’D) I’m giving him the rest of the week. Pink Revisions 51.
C: DANNY
E: not looking up
D: If the guy lifted a cow into a truck, Coney’d still miss the shot. He still can’t remember to wind the film. Thinks it’s a Tommy- gun. I tell him ‘click-advance- click-advance”...
C: TONY
D: Can it. I’m giving it a week.

C: DANNY
D: Like what?
C: LIONEL
D: Sit on a joint for me.
C: DANNY
D: For you?
N: Lionel tosses him the matchbook.
C: LIONEL
D: Club up in Harlem. I think Frank was there that day or the day before...it was in his pants, almost full. Fullsie Pants!
C: DANNY
E: skeptical
D: Maybe he stopped in for a book of matches.
N: LIONEL glances out the window as they talk and sees... TONY, across the street outside the coffee shop stopping at the payphone.
C: LIONEL
D: In the room he was talking about a girl, a colored chick. Something she knew had em pretty unhappy, wondering who else knew. Frank said her father is a busted up vet who runs a club...this joint is three blocks from that meet.
C: DANNY
D: You went there?
C: LIONEL
E: nods
D: Manager is a guy named Billy with a bum arm.

N: LIONEL’S POV: Tony is talking to someone and making notes.
C: LIONEL
D: Well if you got nothing better to do... sit on it a while, see if she shows.
C: DANNY
D: If a colored chick shows up to a jazz joint? Lemme make a prediction...
C: LIONEL
D: No, I’m working another angle. We’ll pin her down.
N: LIONEL’S POV: Tony on his way back.
C: DANNY
D: Okay but tell me something... What are we doing this for?
C: LIONEL
D: Cause he’d a done it for us.
C: DANNY
D: Right. It’s fuckin’ cold for a sit.
C: LIONEL
D: Take the Bel Air, heater’ll roast you like a brisket. Bet on the bris!
C: DANNY
D: You’re a rabbi too now, huh?
C: LIONEL
D: You don’t want me handling your bris, believe me.
N: Pink Revisions 54. They both laugh. INT. LIONEL’S CAR - DAY He drifts through Brooklyn. EXT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - DAY Lionel crosses the street heading for a nondescript office building. Checks the address and enters. INT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - A HALLWAY - DAY Lionel finds a door with just a number on it. Checks his info again, takes out a piece of gum, folds it exactly in half and pops it in his mouth and then enters into... INT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS An open space with desks pushed up against one another. Low budget informality. A few private offices with doors at the far end and right in front by the door... Lionel enters and goes to close the door but has to re-open it and close it twice more to make it sound right. He’s good at stakeouts, not at this part. HIS EYES flick around... People busy at work on phones, typing, filling out forms, conferring with each other. A few middle-aged Jewish men and women, and, Lionel immediately notices, FOUR YOUNG BLACK WOMEN, working in different parts of the room: one typing, one walking papers back to one of the offices... One at a reception desk, looking up at Lionel.
C: LIONEL

E: covers
D: My myna bird, Myrna!. No I believe she was a colored girl.
C: RECEPTIONIST
E: BETTY
D: Josephine or Laura?
N: She points at each as she says their names and Lionel makes note of their faces.
C: LIONEL
D: No I’m sure it was Mildred. She spoke to me on the phone about my application. What’s your name?
C: RECEPTIONIST
E: BETTY
D: Betty. What sort of application.
C: LIONEL
D: My vendor’s license.
N: Blank stare LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Is this not the licensing office?

D: It’s the Committee on Racial Discrimination in Housing.
C: LIONEL
E: laughs too loud
D: Then you can’t very well help me sell hot dogs can you! I’m sorry to have bothered you.
N: Pink Revisions 56. He tips his hat and starts to head out the door. On a hunch turns back and takes a flyer... LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Is Mr. Horowitz in by any chance?

D: You mean Mrs. Horowitz?
C: LIONEL
D: Either one’ll do.
C: RECEPTIONIST
E: BETTY
E: really confused now
D: She’s in the back...oh there she is...
N: They look and see Gabby Horowitz, director of the Committee, just stepping from her office with LAURA, one of the black girls. They see Betty pointing and look up. Lionel waves and points as though to say “I’ll see you outside” and quickly exits... Gabby and LAURA look at each other. Who the hell was that? INT. LIONEL’S CAR/EXT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - DAY A CAMERA LENS REFLECTING THE OLD INDUSTRIAL BUILDING Lionel sits in the car across the street and checks the focus. PLUCKS AT HIS CUFF. Looks through the lens and perks up THROUGH THE CAMERA we see... LAURA emerge, STRIKINGLY PRETTY with LIGHT BROWN SKIN; CLICK. CLICK. LIONEL KEEPS WATCHING, muttering to himself.
C: LIONEL
D: Horse-a-whip, Whore-a-witch, Horowitz.
N: He watches her walk away the flicks back to the door A BUNCH OF PEOPLE FROM THE OFFICE, including Horowitz and THE OTHER THREE BLACK GIRLS. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. He’s popping off shots of them all expertly, like a marksman. This he’s good at. She steps to the curb and hails a CAB. LIONEL starts his car. Mission accomplished. Pink Revisions 57. INT. L & L OFFICE - DARKROOM - NIGHT WHITE PAPER, SWISHING IN LIQUID A picture emerges... the girl named LAURA. Very beautiful. Lionel pulls it out of the tray and stares at it, then lets it dry with the others already printed.
C: TONY
E: O.S.
D: Holy shit, what happened?!
N: Lionel rushes out into... INT. L & L OFFICE - NIGHT DANNY stands slumped against the door frame with TONY rushing to support him. DANNY HAS BEEN BEATEN UP. He is very shaken, out of breath. Tony moves Danny to a chair and loosens his tie. Danny motions that he needs a drink and CONEY quickly pours him a shot from a bottle in a desk. Danny downs it with a shaky hand.
C: CONEY
D: Who was it, D?
C: DANNY
D: Couple of em. One was a giant.
C: TONY
D: A what?
C: DANNY
D: A fuckin’ giant, I’m telling you. Biggest guy I ever saw.

C: LIONEL
D: They say anything?
N: Pink Revisions 58.
C: DANNY
D: Yeah, “Stay outta Minna’s garbage. Tell your crew the same.” Had a big nasty knife on my throat for that part.

D: Son of a...
N: Danny reaches into his pocket...
C: DANNY
E: to LIONEL
D: Didn’t get this though...assholes.
N: Tosses Lionel a ROLL OF FILM.
C: TONY
D: ...the fuck is that? What are you two into?
N: Danny looks at Lionel...and we CUT TO: INT. L & L OFFICE - HALF HOUR LATER Danny is cleaned up a little, butterfly bandage over his swelling shiner, holding ice to his lip. The RED LIGHT of the dark room goes out. Lionel emerges with some still wet photos: Danny’s roll... He hustles to Danny takes three of his own photos, one of each of the young black women, and lays them out on a desk to compare with Danny’s. Danny looks over his shoulder, can’t help being curious. Lionel starts to flip through them.... DANNY’S PHOTOS: - The outside of the King Rooster club - The guy, BILLY, emerging from the club - A man in a hat, face unseen, asking Billy for a light - Over the man’s shoulder on Billy looking away
C: DANNY
D: Forget all that, she didn’t show up until later...tail end of the roll.

C: CONEY
D: How the hell you know that?
C: LIONEL
E: ignores him
D: You tailed her?
C: DANNY
D: Didn’t have to...she lives right next to the club on the corner. They musta made me earlier. Soon as I got out the car to follow her they were on me...
N: He stops. It really shook him up. Lionel is excited though. Tony’s paying attention.
C: LIONEL
D: I’m telling you this is the colored broad Frank was tailing.
C: TONY
D: Okay, I’m with you but it’s still pretty thin.
C: CONEY
D: Skeletal.
N: Pink Revisions 60.
C: LIONEL
D: We only just started!
N: They look at each other for a beat. Tony seems to be calculating something. His attitude has changed.
C: TONY
D: Whatever they want so bad’s gotta be worth something, right? I’ll tell you what, Freakshow, me and Gil’ll stay on the money work, keep us floating...you and Danny keep sniffing it and we’ll see where we get.
C: LIONEL
D: I ain’t looking to make a deal with these fucks but yeah, okay.

N: Pink Revisions 61.
C: LIONEL
D: For Julia? She can go twist.
C: TONY
D: Okay whatever. But don’t go holding out on shit with me though. We work together, okay Lionel? I’ll take anything we can scratch up to Mr. Capodanno and see what those boys know. We pin it on someone, we’ll square accounts. My word on it.
N: Lionel looks at him and nods, then gets up. TONY (cont’d) (CONT’D) You wanna get a beer?
C: LIONEL
D: Nah, I’m going home. I’ll see ya later.
N: Tony taps him on the shoulder in Lionel’s rhythm, teasing.
C: TONY
D: C’mon...let’s get a beer.
N: Lionel laughs at their old gag but shakes his head.
C: TONY
E: CONT’D
D: Okay but don’t stay up too late, Kemosabe.
N: He exits. Lionel stares at the photo of Laura and as we push in on her image we CUT TO: EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - MORNING A passerby crosses the street in the cold passing through a small PARK where we find: LIONEL, sipping coffee, twitching a little and mumbling to himself. He seems happier when he’s alone, less anxious about his tics. Almost seems to enjoy turning words over...
C: LIONEL
D: Laura Rose. Rose is a rose is a rose... Larosa!
N: And then he sees...LAURA comes out of her building, and he’s out and moving to follow her... She walks along in the cold, LIONEL sliding into view behind her as she makes her way to... Pink Revisions 62. EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - MORNING Laura heads down the steps...Lionel follows. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING Laura boards the train and moves toward an empty seat only to have a WHITE GUY move his bag onto the seat and stare at her as the train begins to move. She stares at the man with no expression and he back at her, daring her. She turns her back to him leans against a pole, facing directly at LIONEL, which makes him feel a tic coming that he comically struggles to suppress. She takes a book from her bag, some sort of textbook and begins to read, studying and with this he turns away to release a tic and shout. A WOMAN WITH A SMALL GIRL reacts to this and moves the child away from him. This makes Laura look up over her book for a moment, just as he turns back around and they meet each others gaze for just a second. She is composed and lovely. EXT. FORT GREENE ROW-HOUSE STREET - DAY Laura walks down a block with Lionel tailing behind. The neighborhood is edgy, run down, with many boarded up row houses, uncollected trash and abandoned furnishings. LAURA goes up a stoop and rings a bell. A BLACK LADY answers, wary. Laura talks for a moment and removes some papers from her bag, handing them to the woman. The woman glances at them, nods and closes the door. ANOTHER DOOR. She buzzes. A FACE IN THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW... a wave. ANOTHER BLACK LADY smiles and hands Laura a sheaf of the same forms and they talk. Lionel can see that the woman is indignant and that Laura is TAKING NOTES. ANOTHER DOOR...this building so bombed out it looks abandoned but AN OLD BLACK MAN WRAPPED IN A BLANKET OPENS and this time Laura goes inside. Lionel glimpses her in the window of the first floor. LIONEL turns around for a closer look at a row-house behind him, its front door and second story windows boarded up. He looks up AT THE FRONT DOOR Pink Revisions 63. A SIGN: CONDEMNED: PROPERTY OF: BELMONT DEVELOPERS... A SOUND SURPRISES HIM and he jumps. To his surprise a WOMAN WITH TWO KIDS COME OUT from the garden level door under the stoop. He thought it was abandoned but clearly there are people squatting here. The WOMAN eyes him fearfully and hustles her kids away. EXT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - DAY TIGHT ON: A PUDDLE OF WATER. Stark trees, fire escapes & sky reflected in it as LAURA steps across it, rippling the surface and we tilt up to find LIONEL tailing her. He watches as she heads for a nondescript storefront/office: Inwood Residential Services. She goes to the door and tries it but it’s locked. She turns and faces the street, clearly exasperated as a CAR pulls up and GABBY gets out of the driver side. She and Laura confer and Laura moves to get in the car. LIONEL spots a cab and hails it but hustles over to the storefront for a quick look at the sign on the door: “INWOOD: Your Happy Home is Our Business!”. HOURS: 9-5 Lionel looks at his watch: 3:21 Should be open. But he hustles to his cab. INT. CAB / EXT. ROADSIDE/OVERPASS - LATE AFTERNOON The cab pulls over on the shoulder, a distance from the other car which is pulled up under an overpass, with hazard lights on. Lionel’s POV: the women getting out.
C: LIONEL
D: Get out and pop your hood and check the oil.
C: CABBIE
D: Buddy, come on...
C: LIONEL
D: Keep the meter going.
N: He lifts his binoculars as the cabbie grudgingly complies. Lionel’s POV: Gabby shading her eyes, looking up at... Pink Revisions 64. LAURA, who has climbed up the slope to the overpass above and is lowering a tape measure. We PAN DOWN with the tape measure to Gabby, who records the height of the overpass. ON LIONEL: no idea what they’re doing. SMASH CUT TO: INT. TOWN HALL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS FACES IN A BUZZING SEATED CROWD as we tilt up to see GABBY & LAURA, hustling down the center aisle of a packed auditorium to where their staff members hold seats near a standing mic. A group of men at two long tables on stage with mics. Among the men, THE MAYOR and LIEBERMAN. LIONEL enters in the back and takes in the scene. He notes a guy in the back rows with ‘PRESS’ cards in his hat band and slides into a seat behind him. Lionel leans over his shoulder and takes out his notebook to play at being a fellow reporter
C: LIONEL
D: This ain’t my beat. What’s the story?
C: REPORTER
E: JACOB GLEASON
D: Stories of injustice and despair, nodding heads and assurances, back to business as usual. The American Way. Although this one could make it interesting.
N: He indicates GABBY down the aisle conferring with Laura. He sees Gabby catch sight of: a TALL THIN MAN entering and taking his seat. Slightly frayed but hawk-like eyes focused intently on the proceedings. He nods at Gabby. Lionel deftly slips one of the reporter’s cards from his hatband and pockets it with practiced ease. A man onstage kicks things off. WILLIAM LIEBERMAN, one of Moses Randolph’s sub-bosses.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: We’ll commence this public comment. State your name, address and affiliation please. I’m William Lieberman, Mayor’s Commission on Slum Clearance, resident of E.65th St, Manhattan
N: Pink Revisions 65.
C: LADY AT MICROPHONE
D: Cindy Fleming, homemaker, Yonkers...but formerly East Tremont. My family was forced to move when they seized our building for the Bronx Expressway, and I want people to know that--

C: LIEBERMAN
D: Mrs. Horowitz, you may not hijack these proceedings to air out old complaints against...
C: GABBY
E: rapidly, following rule
D: Gabby Horowitz-Committee on Racial Discrimination in Housing- 552 Clinton Ave, BROOKLYN. I thought this was a community hearing?
C: LIEBERMAN
D: On housing not highways...
N: Lionel focuses on him... his VOICE familiar...
C: GABBY
D: You’re making the same promises to Ft Greene that you made in Tremont, where your so-called ‘relocation services’ vanished into thin air and left families like the Flemings utterly adrift. People have a right to know what they’re in for!
N: Lionel watches LAURA, slipping Gabby notes.
C: LIEBERMAN
D: We are totally committed to the welfare of families displaced by necessary community improvement programs. The past has been instructive and our new contractors will ensure ALL find adequate homes...
N: As she speaks MOSES RANDOLPH enters late from the side, tuning in and already impatient. Gabby notes his arrival. Pink Revisions 66.
C: GABBY
D: This isn’t Long Island you know... It’s not just a blank canvas you can paint on anywhere you like. There are people here, established communities.
N: Randolph shoots an impatient look at the Mayor as he SITS...The Mayor snaps up obediently...
C: MAYOR
E: a few laughs
D: I hope you all know my name. I’m the Mayor, newly residing at Gracie Mansion, Manhattan. Mrs Horowitz, thank you for work and your passion. Surely we can all agree that even in a City as great as ours we have slums. And that a slum is not something to romanticize or preserve. You tear it down and improve quality of--
C: GABBY
E: to Randolph
D: A neighborhood is not a slum because poor people and minorities live there, Mr. Mayor. East Tremont wasn’t a slum, Third Avenue wasn’t a slum and Fort Greene is not a slum either, these are working class communities. Your developers are making it a slum!
N: This brings Randolph lunging forward.
C: RANDOLPH
D: That is unsubstantiated, unmitigated bunk!
N: Laura hands her reams of paper which she holds aloft...
C: GABBY
D: We have it on paper, we have twenty people here tonight and scores behind them who can testify to a scandalous fraud under way...which way would you like it first?
N: Randolph slaps the table with his flat palm violently, rising out of his chair and overlapping her. Pink Revisions 67.
C: RANDOLPH
D: We are embarking on the most ambitious slum clearance program in American history Mrs. Horowitz and you are gumming it up with your molasses! A Niagara of molasses!
N: Suddenly a voice in the audience shouts:
C: VOICE
E: PAUL
D: MAKE HIM SAY HIS NAME!
N: Heads turn. Lionel turns. Concern on Gabby’s face. ANGLE ON: THE TALL THIN MAN, still seated.
C: MAN
E: PAUL
D: Name and place of residence, like everyone else!
N: A smattering of applause. The energy is winding Lionel up, his arm and head jerk spasmodically. RANDOLPH stares out seeking the source of the voice, eyes narrowing, glaring. He crosses his arms defiantly. He looks at the Mayor: “Handle it.” The MAYOR rises.
C: MAYOR
D: Now see here, we all know perfectly well who this is... Mo Randolph is one our greatest public servants. He’s a living legend.
C: MAN
E: PAUL
D: Name and residence like everybody else!
N: The audience cheers, really behind it now. Some start to call out “Make him say it! Make him say it!” Gabby smiles discreetly. Lionel yelps-
C: LIONEL
D: Every Chevy shelf!
N: Randolph glares at the Mayor who is starting to sweat. Pink Revisions 68.
C: MAYOR
E: trying to stay light
D: He’s led the Parks Department for over 30 years...he’s Commissioner of Construction, well, he’s got too many jobs to name!
N: Cat calls... a few yells...many people rising to their feet The MAN rises to his feet now, raging..
C: MAN
E: PAUL
D: Make him say it!!
C: MAYOR
D: See here now, if we can’t keep this civil we’ll have to ask you to...
C: MAN
E: PAUL
D: SAY IT!
N: The crowd chants “Say it!” This is too much for Lionel... Lieberman nods to some plainclothes SECURITY MEN along the sides of the room who quickly descend on the MAN. And now the crowd is on its feet indignant. As they sweep behind LIONEL with the MAN (Paul) it’s too much him and he leaps up shrieking
C: LIONEL
D: Two fucking pigs in a blanket!
N: So they grab him too and hustle him out with the MAN (Paul) LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Say it, Hammy Ham House Heads!! SMASH CUT TO: EXT. TOWN HALL MEETING/BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT Lionel and the MAN shrug off the final SHOVES of the cops and stand looking at each other in the street. THE MAN is neatly dressed but his clothes are visibly worn and shabby. Gaunt and graying, he could be taken for a bum but his eyes are fierce and sharp, hawkish. We will come to know him as Paul. Pink Revisions 69. He regards Lionel with curiosity...
C: PAUL
D: ‘Hammy Ham House Head’, huh? That’s good. I’ll have to remember that one.
C: LIONEL
E: still ticcing
D: IF! Sorry... IF!
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, that’s the rub in life alright... ‘if’... ‘if only’...
N: He shakes his head and starts to walk away muttering to himself unintelligibly. Lionel stuffs gum, getting under control, calls out
C: LIONEL
D: Hey, hold on... tell me something. That guy Lieberman, he’s in charge of this Hamilton deal?
C: PAUL
E: laughs, turns away
D: In charge? No, he’s not in charge...More in charge than that guy calling himself Mayor but... They all work formosa...
N: CU: Lionel’s face as he barely hears that last word. He runs after Paul and grabs him by the arm... PAUL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Hey...!
C: LIONEL
D: You said “Formosa”...what’s that?
C: PAUL
D: What? Let me go! You nuts?!
C: LIONEL
D: You said “They’re all working Formosa.” What’s that mean?
C: PAUL
E: realizing
D: What’s ‘Formosa’? Let go of me. “For Moses.” Jesus. I said they’re working for Moses. Moses Randolph.
N: Pink Revisions 70. Lionel realizes: that’s what Frank said to him as he lay dying -- “For Moses”...
C: LIONEL
D: Mo Randolph? That guy who came in?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah...‘He who will not speak his name like one of the rabble’. What do you care?
N: Lionel quickly pulls out the reporter’s card.
C: LIONEL
D: Jacob Gleason, the Post. Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
C: PAUL
D: I’m hungry. You can buy me dinner.
N: INT. DINER - NIGHT Paul digs in like a guy who eats too rarely. Lionel pops gum and nurses a tea... Paul talks like a firehose...disgorging so much information, even as he chews, that it’s hard to keep up with the thread. Huge pent up frustration venting in urgent torrents with hardly a pause between thoughts...
C: PAUL
E: appalled
D: The Mayor?! That clown is so green he doesn’t even know what he doesn’t know yet. He’ll be out the door before he even realizes that every person he turns to for advice is on Randolph’s payroll.
C: LIONEL
D: I thought he was Commissioner of Parks?
C: PAUL
D: He is.
C: LIONEL
D: But they called him Construction Commissioner.
N: Pink Revisions 71.
C: PAUL
D: He’s that too now. They never even had that position until the Feds decided to get in the housing game. It had no defined powers so he defined ‘em and the Feds approved and now how much control of that money has the City got? Zero. He's got it all. You know what 'eminent domain' means? If he says it's a slum, it goes. He used to have to fight to put his highways and parks where he wanted, now he can go anywhere, tear anything down. He can condemn a whole section of the city, evict everyone who lives there and put up what he wants. And he'll go at it with an axe.
C: LIONEL
D: SMACKS AXE. He’ll piss too many people off. He’ll be the most hated man in NY.
C: PAUL
D: No, they love him! That’s what makes me so... He flies above it. They revere him.
C: LIONEL
D: Why?
C: PAUL
E: mouths ‘Negroes’
D: Because he built the parks! As long as you're the guy who brings people parks, you walk with the angels, you can't lose. The day Rockaway Beach opened, Moses Randolph became a folk hero in this town. But people don't realize how much he hates them. “The Hero of the Public Who Hates People”. There's your headline. And you know who he hates especially? He's going to seize every neighborhood in this city that's not white and turn it over to his hand-picked private Developers.
C: LIONEL
D: So he’s getting rich. Paid off.
N: Pink Revisions 72.
C: PAUL
E: to a waitress
D: Nah, he doesn't want money...he wants control and he brokers money to get it and guard it. Some men aren't satisfied unless they have filet mignon. Moses would be happy with a pastrami sandwich and power. Can I get a piece of cheesecake? And warm it up. Yeah, I want it warm!
C: LIONEL
D: But you said they just created the position...so how...?
C: PAUL
D: Oh, christ...Construction-Parks- Slums...he’s got 14 appointments! That’s all just ink on a glass door, none of it matters, it’s all the BA.
C: LIONEL
D: BA?
N: This actually stops Paul and makes him narrow his eyes.
C: PAUL
D: The Borough Authority, jeezus. Where do you come from, Iowa? Call yourself a reporter...on what, the Arts beat? You read Emerson?
C: LIONEL
E: shakes no
D: Should I?
N: Pink Revisions 73.
C: PAUL
D: Yes, you fucking should! Emerson said “an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man”...
N: EXT. BOROUGH AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Headlights of the waiting CAR light up the front of the massive stone face and steps of the edifice where Moses works.
C: PAUL
E: O.S.
D: This town is run by the Borough Authority and the Borough Authority is Moses Randolph.
N: As the tall shadowy figure descends the stairs toward the cars his SHADOW THROWS HIGH OVER THE FACE OF THE BUILDING. INT. ENTRANCE LOBBY OF NY PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY Lionel walks through the grand marble lobby. INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - GRAND READING ROOM - DAY Lionel walks into the huge room carrying a few huge bound volumes of newspapers and sits at a table C.U. - Articles on Moses Randolph. One after another announcing his accomplishments “West River Park Opens”, “Hudson Highway”, “A Grand New Beach for Gotham”, “Bronx Expressway to Liberate Manhattan from Traffic Snarl”. And effusions of Randolph: “Servant of the People”; “A Reformer becomes a Builder: ‘to build is to dream’ says Moses Randolph” PICTURES: the Triborough Bridge under construction. Moses smiling and shaking hands with one Mayor after another: LaGuardia; O’Dwyer; Impellitieri; the new Mayor... Lionel stops on one: “The Men of the B.A.” - a photo shows Randolph seated and smiling broadly, surrounded by men in Suits. Their names captioned: William Lieberman, George Spaulding, Tom Brooks... LIONEL FOCUSES ON: William Lieberman. He was the man in the apartment with Minna. The one in charge... Pink Revisions 74.
C: LIONEL
E: whispered
D: Lieberman. Leering man.
N: CLOSE ON: another article...”The Private Life of a Public Man...many of his closest colleagues were surprised to learn he has a brother.” PICTURE: a YOUNGER MOSES RANDOLPH and A MAN WHO LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR...both in black tie attire and smiling...Randolph leans affectionately on his brother’s shoulder CAPTION: “Moses Randolph and Paul Randolph: 1927” LIONEL’s FACE: recognizing Paul Randolph as the man he bought dinner for.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: That quack in the diner with pork chop and peas in his beard was one of the most talented engineers of his generation. Ivy League. Big awards. Walking right next to his brother toward being someone important. Then sometime right after the Crash, just nothing. Like he got erased.
N: He takes out his pen-knife and quietly cuts out this photo and pockets it. INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - READING ROOM - LATER
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Maybe bad luck. Maybe booze. There was all kinds of casualties in those days.
N: TIME CUT: Lionel is handing the box of papers back to a clerk when he sees the clerk’s paper lying open and a small HEADLINE: “BUILDER’S ASSOC TO HONOR Moses Randolph....Plaza Hotel” EXT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING INT. PLAZA HOTEL - CONCOURSE OUTSIDE BALLROOM/BALLROOM Black tie crowd. Working class, union bosses, wives...but dressed up and slicked for their one big night. Pink Revisions 75. Martini glasses and cigarettes. Union security at the doors to the Banquet with pins on their lapels. LIONEL steps out of elevators behind a few late arrivals who hustle in. Inside beyond the check in table the vast floor of banquet tables and stage can be seen. Not in a tux and with no invite he clearly can’t go in the normal way. A BELL, signals the start of the program and people flow back in. Lionel moves across to another door...more to the side, and slides up to the UNION SECURITY APE. He pulls the edge of an envelope from inside his jacket...
C: LIONEL
D: Gotta get this to Bill Lieberman.
N: The pea-brain UNION APE knows that name well enough to have to think... LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) He’s gonna want to see this before Randolph sits back down with him... Too many big names to risk it. The guy waves him in and we begin to hear...
C: SPEAKER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, settle please and give me your serious attention. Our celebration is made special by tonight’s Guest of Honor...
N: INT. PLAZA HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: SPEAKER
E: CONT’D
D: ...A Brother to our Trade who would rightly be hailed this country’s Master Builder. Or...the ‘Great Dirt Mover’, as he likes to be called!
N: LIONEL: slides into a back corner, waiters flowing in and out past him. He looks left and spots... JACOB GLEASON, the reporter from the public hearing, in a tux. He sees Lionel and thumbs his nose in solidarity. Lionel slides up next to him. Gleason nods, impressed Lionel got in without a tux. Pink Revisions 76.
C: LIONEL
D: Gleason, right?
C: GLEASON
D: Don’t let em see you take out a notebook. Tonight is: ‘Press: fuggedaboudit’.
C: SPEAKER
E: CONT’D
D: We’d have to look to the Caesars and Pharaohs to find men with a scale of vision to compare with his and yet none of it bears his name, so fully does he forbear the credit, allowing the people to say “we built this ourselves.” A great man, a man of history, serving the people of this City for over 25 years...Moses Randolph!
N: A ERUPTION OF APPLAUSE: As Randolph takes the stage. He tries to speak and they won’t let him. Shouting as though for a general after a triumph...
C: LIONEL
D: You’d think Patton showed up.
C: GLEASON
D: He pays one and half times union rate as base on all his jobs. They’d pave over their mothers for him.
N: Lionel’s eyes cast around...spotting faces: Lieberman and the others from the papers. POV: in the shadows against a column...Paul. Clutching a large, full envelope. Staring, inscrutable. He snags two rolls from a passing tray, munches one and stuffs the other into his suit pocket. Randolph begins speaking...
C: RANDOLPH
E: MORE
D: Tonight, over 300 years since the founding of this great city, we recommit ourselves to the ancient truth...that it is not knowledge but Action...Enterprise...which is the engine and objective of life. Clever men come and go but for every dozen men with a bright idea there is at most one who can execute them.
N: Pink Revisions 77.
C: RANDOLPH
E: CONT'D
E: huge laughter
D: I look around this room and I don’t see a lot of Bright Boys or Goodie Goodie progressives with their paralyzing ideals! I see men of my tribe. Men who know how to Get Things Done! The Doers who make this country great. And an honor by you is all the affirmation or payment I’ll ever seek. I thank you and celebrate you.
N: Wild applause...the crowd comes to its feet again. LIONEL watches: Randolph descends the stage. He’s mobbed by the bosses high and low...all pressing up to pay respects. Eventually Moses has to break away. Lionel’s eyes flick to: Paul...realizing that Randolph will not be exiting past him, moves urgently to cross the room toward him. His envelope under his arm, hunting for a line to cut Randolph off before he leaves. But the crowd surges and Paul is blocked. RANDOLPH spots Paul though. They LOCK EYES for just a second...Randolph frowns, surprised. But something in Paul’s face makes him pause...something both insistent and pleading. He sees what Paul is holding and his eyes narrow, weighing. A small nod...a crack opens that Paul sees and almost palpably steps toward...But Randolph’s face seems to say ‘Not here.’ LIEBERMAN whispers something to him and with a final look at Paul he turns and is led out the side exit. Paul’s jaw clenches but his eyes are alight and he hustles for an exit...and LIONEL FOLLOWS... EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE AVENUE - NIGHT LIONEL follows Paul and then peeks around a corner to find Paul pacing in the dark along a nice apartment building, near the edge of the light from the canopied doorway. He’s waiting, not hiding. THE BIG BLACK CAR pulls up...Paul straightens his hat and smooths his jacket as.....RANDOLPH GETS OUT. Paul steps out of the dark, blocking the path to the doorway. RANDOLPH stops and they stand facing each other in a BEAM OF LIGHT FROM THE DOORWAY. Pink Revisions 78. Lionel leans around the corner to listen and we can see it playing out behind Lionel like a shadow play that we hear bits of.
C: RANDOLPH
D: You finished it.
C: PAUL
D: Best work I’ve ever done. A total modernization of the state’s electrical grid. And it’s a scale only you can get done.
N: Randolph weighs this. Takes it and moves inside.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Clean yourself up for Chrissake...
C: PAUL
D: With what!?
C: RANDOLPH
D: Not fucking word out of you about any of that! Bring that up to me ever again I’ll close you out...
C: PAUL
D: Close me out?! I’m so far out I’m doing piece work for kids fresh out of school!
C: RANDOLPH
D: Whip up a crowd against me like that ever again and I’ll take your big idea and throw it on the scrap heap! That what you want?
C: PAUL
E: desperate
D: No! NO!! Alright, I’m sorry. None of that matters. Just...read it please.
C: RANDOLPH
E: beat
D: I’ll read it.
N: He turns and goes inside. Paul stands, staring into the light after his brother, his thin coat blowing around him but his head up high. For a moment he seems straightened up by hope. Then he turns and walks into the dark. Pink Revisions 79.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: What makes a person go against their own brother? All my life I never had family so I never could understand people who did and let it get ugly.
N: Lionel watches a beat...then turns away into dark. EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - MORNING LIONEL hustling through the crowd in the cold.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: My crazy brain was telling me to pull on that thread, but whatever Frank found, he found it following the girl. So I just kept chasing his footsteps.
N: INT. LIONEL’S CAR #2/EXT. FORT GREENE STREET/BROWNSTONES Lionel drives down a street looking for an address. Even more desolate and run down than the first place he followed Laura, a once happy lower-middle class neighborhood of brownstones, now ravaged, boarded up windows everywhere. A tense atmosphere... Suddenly he spots LAURA coming down a stoop with a young BLACK MAN. He is talking fast, ANGRY. Lionel parks and watches in the rear view mirror as they go up into another dilapidated brownstone. Lionel gets out and approaches the stoop. Spies that the ground floor door under the stoop is swinging open. Knocks, waits, looks around...and enters into... INT. DILAPIDATED BROWNSTONE - DAY Darker inside...gloomy. He can hear voices upstairs. Daylight cutting through in hard shafts. We can see that this was a nice middle class home, but it looks like it’s been strip-mined. An empty space where the fridge should be, fixtures ripped away, nice walls cut open to remove sections of copper pipe, now dripping. Pink Revisions 80. INT. DILAPIDATED BROWNSTONE - BATHROOM - DAY Lionel pokes into a bathroom and clicks the light on...it still works, dimly sputtering. Nice tiles broken to get at pipes, sink fixtures gone. He looks at himself in the mirror, watching impassively as his own head TWITCHES and SPASMS mildly.
C: LIONEL
E: to himself
D: Keep it together, freakshow.
N: He reaches for the vanity mirror and opens it to see what’s inside only to find... POV: he’s looking clear into the next room. The wall behind the mirror has been opened and pipes stripped out. Then... A BLACK GUY STEPS INTO THE FRAME OUT OF NOWHERE, looking at Lionel who jolts and with a yelp steps back into... The ANGRY GUY LAURA was with, now blocking the door.
C: ANGRY GUY
D: Looking for somethin’?
C: LIONEL
D: Scared the hell...HELP, BAILEY!
N: They look round for who he’s calling out to...
C: ANGRY GUY
D: You think you can just walk into people’s homes?
C: LIONEL
D: Looking for a friend. Didn’t look like anyone lived down here...
C: ANGRY GUY
D: Oh, someone live here. My momma live here. Least she tryin’ to. Who you with? I hope you with Belmont.
N: Sounds like an angle, so Lionel nods.
C: LIONEL
D: Yeah...course. Belmont. Who else, right?
N: Pink Revisions 81. He looks back to the other guy...and the FIST IS ALREADY CRASHING INTO HIS FACE BLACK OUT. INT. DILAPIDATED BROWNSTONE - PARLOR ROOM Muted sounds of argument and feet. The sharp sound of heels. FADE UP SLOWLY... WOOZY POV: Faces out of focus.
C: LAURA
D: How hard did you hit him?
C: ANGRY GUY
D: I barely tapped him. Fool slipped and hit his own head!
N: Lionel sits up a little and focuses, his nose slightly bloody
C: LIONEL
D: IF!!
C: LAURA
E: pauses
D: ‘If’ what? I’ll tell you what ‘if’, you better explain who you are if you want to walk out of-- Have I seen you before?
C: LIONEL
E: nods - seizing the angle
D: My name’s Jake Gleason. I’m a reporter. I saw you at the Hamilton housing hearing. I called the committee. Came out here looking for you.
N: She glares at the YOUNG MAN. He looks chagrined.
C: ANGRY GUY
D: He the one said he’s with them racketeering sons a bitches! They stole her damn fridge and her copper pipe! What you expect?!
N: Pink Revisions 82. EXT. FORT GREENE STREET/INT. MYSTERY CAR - LATER Lionel has tissue up his nose as they walk.
C: LAURA
D: First they put up a notice says the house will be condemned. It’s not true but that scares out about half and they sell for cheap. Then they come in and take the nice old family homes and chop em into 4 and rent em up. Folks who don’t leave they harass... turn the heat off, come in to do repairs and steal copper pipe instead. They re-possessed all the refrigerators, even if people bought them themselves, then resold them out of shopfronts next neighborhood over. City sold em property worth $15 million for $500,000 to take the ‘risk’ of having to build the Federal projects. They haven’t even submitted plans...just milked it until it really is a slum.
C: LIONEL
D: Slammer for Slum Lords, Bailey!
C: LAURA
E: bristling
D: Oh what, you another one that thinks we’re just ‘agitating’... making it up like some Negro propaganda conspiracy...
C: LIONEL
E: stopping her
D: No, no. Look I got a condition, I say funny things sometimes but I’m not trying to be funny, okay? I’m listening. Where’s everybody go?
C: LAURA
D: Mostly just disappear. Fade away. Go into real slums or other neighborhoods. Some are renting a room in a house they used to own. 200,000 in 2 years just from this part of Brooklyn. Mostly Negro. Latino.
N: Pink Revisions 83.
C: LIONEL
D: But Horowitz said they did it in Tremont too.
C: LAURA
D: Yeah they did it to a few Jews too but not systematic like this. You know how many parks have been built in this city since he’s been Commissioner? 255. How many of those in Harlem you think? 1. You build a new beach for the ‘people’, but the ones with no cars, the poor ones, the black and brown ones?...how are they going get to the parks and beaches? Public bus. Guess how high they just built the overpasses on the new parkway? One foot too low for a bus to clear.
N: Lionel gives an incredulous look...
C: LAURA
E: CONT’D
D: Look forget whether it’s discrimination...the Federal government and the City are being scammed! There’s supposed to be relocation services, company’s got a $2 million dollar contract to handle it but nobody even answers the phone. Call the city, they say these folks are on the list for the new public housing. But then it never gets built.
N: They have come to Lionel’s car. He stops.
C: LIONEL
D: You know more’n any secretary I ever met.
C: LAURA
E: indignant
D: Secretary? Who told you that? I’ve got a law degree you know? I’ll pass the Bar first time I sit too.
N: He’s staring at her now...she’s beautiful to him. She catches it and blushes...then sharpens her look, suspicious. Pink Revisions 84. LAURA (cont’d) (CONT’D) How are you gonna write about it all when you don’t even take a note?
C: LIONEL
D: “2 million for relocation; bridges a foot too low for buses; 1 out of 255 parks; $15 mil for $500k; 200,000 people in Ft Greene alone”. I never forget anything, believe me. Not a single word.
N: She nods, impressed. He’s strange but he really looks at her and listens. He can’t help it and has to tap her twice on the shoulder. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Sorry...I really can’t help it.
C: LAURA
E: softens
D: It’s okay. Just write about it, okay? What happens to poor people in this city wasn’t news yesterday and it won’t be tomorrow. But you’d think somebody’d care what happens to Brooklyn. It’s only the biggest city on Earth.
N: She sighs and looks away.
C: LIONEL
D: Where do you live?
C: LAURA
D: Harlem.
C: LIONEL
D: I can give you a ride. Trains’ll be mobbed.
N: That surprises her but she looks at him and then nods. POV: SOMEBODY IN A CAR WATCHES THEM GET IN AND STARTS HIS ENGINE ALONG WITH THEM. INT. LIONEL’S CAR #2 - LATE AFTERNOON INTO NIGHT She puts on the radio and finds a Jazz station as... MONTAGE: Lionel drives them through the city Pink Revisions 85. They don’t say much of anything at all but some faster ‘bop’ on the radio activates his tics which he tries to hide which only makes it worse.
C: LIONEL
D: Bebop, Bailey in the Metropolitan BOPera House! Shit. Sorry.
C: LAURA
D: Don’t be sorry, it’s kinda funny.
C: LIONEL
D: Yeah. Hang around a little longer.
N: She can see that it weighs on him. Notices the twitching now
C: LAURA
D: What is all that anyway?
C: LIONEL
D: I don’t know. It’s like a piece of my head split off and got a life of its own but then decided to keep joyriding me for kicks. Kicks and ticks! Licks and ticks! Sorry. It’s like living with a fucking anarchist. But the flip side is its gotta have everything in its right place, everything has to sound just right or it’ll tie me into knots until I fix it. Like I’m talking to you but that piece of my head? It’s worrying that the bills in my wallet aren’t all facing the same direction. It’s not fair.
C: LAURA
D: Hey, I guess we all got our daily battles, right?
N: This makes him stop and take her in, remembers what she must deal with.
C: LIONEL
D: Yeah, fair enough. Kiss her face all night, Bailey!
N: He’s mortified by that one but she laughs hard...
C: LIONEL
E: CONT’D
D: I really am sorry, I don’t mean nothing by it
N: Pink Revisions 86.
C: LAURA
D: It’s alright. Really it’s alright
N: She changes the music to a cool ballad and they drive on, crossing the bridge into Manhattan and on up to Harlem as night falls. EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB/INT. MYSTERY CAR - NIGHT POV: Someone in a car is watching them park INT. LIONEL’S CAR/EXT. KING ROOSTER - CONTINUOUS The exterior of the little club is hopping. People hustling inside, some folks having a smoke. A cool little kid in a full suit and hat on the sidewalk acting like a doorman waves at Laura through the window. Laura points to the building next to the club
C: LAURA
D: This is me.
C: LIONEL
D: That must keep you up nights.
C: LAURA
D: My father owns this place. I grew up falling asleep in the back of clubs.
C: LIONEL
D: Pretty hopping on a Monday night.
C: LAURA
D: Yeah, hottest band in the world, all week. I gotta check on one or two things, but...look, are you really interested...in what I was telling you?
C: LIONEL
D: I came looking for you didn’t I?
C: LAURA
D: If you want to come in I can give you a lot more.
N: He looks at the club: it’s exactly the kind of scene that spells disaster for him usually. She smiles Pink Revisions 87. LAURA (cont’d) (CONT’D) You can’t exactly disturb the peace in a small club with a hot band. She indicates ‘C’mon’. He gives in and they get out into.. INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT This place is for real. No mid-town mainstream joint. A lot of energy...buzz of anticipation over who’s playing...a few white Beat kids from Columbia trying to blend in... Almost immediately it starts to infect Lionel. His head jerks and he pops gum right away...Laura points him at a table against the wall and boots two young cats out of it with one look. She heads for the end of the bar and the cash register, bringing the BARTENDER to her with a look. She clearly has the run of the place... As Lionel sits he takes it all in...sees eyes on him. Cocks Minna’s hat back and watches as a WHITE KID comes up nervously to the TRUMPET PLAYER having a drink before his band’s set with his FRENCH GIRLFRIEND and his Piano player.
C: BEATNIK
D: Excuse me, sir...?
N: The TRUMPET PLAYER and his friend flick a look up. BEATNIK (cont’d) (CONT’D) Sorry...I’m a trumpet player too and I really admire your tremolo...I just wondered how you developed that?
C: TRUMPET
D: Suckin’ off little white boys like you. Get the fuck outta here...
N: The TRUMPET PLAYER turns back to his laughing friend, shaking his head.
C: LIONEL
D: SO WHAT, Whitey White Suck Stick!
N: This makes the TRUMPET PLAYER turn in surprise laughing...
C: TRUMPET
D: Whitey White Suck stick! ‘So what’ is right...
N: Pink Revisions 88. LIONEL’S POV: Laura drilling the BARTENDER over something to do with the register count. He’s giving her back talk and she’s not having it. She SLAPS THE BAR HARD TWICE, shutting him up and dresses him down. The TRUMPET PLAYER laughs at this and wags his finger at the bartender then takes the stage.
C: TRUMPET
E: CONT’D
D: How y’all doing tonight? It’s good to be home. We been traveling the world, learning new languages. With new language comes new ideas. We gonna try a few of them on y’all tonight. So strap in.
N: Lionel gets up and moves to the end of the bar to get a drink, watching her and meeting her eye...she starts walking toward him and SMILES and it makes things slow down for a second...and then right as she takes the stool next to him...the MUSIC kicks in... A HARD FAST SNARE RIFF: and then it’s ON. It hits Lionel like a shot and he WHOOPS loud...but so does half the joint...and for once he doesn’t seem so weird. Laura laughs and we JUMP CUT INTO: INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT A SEQUENCE: Lionel is getting drunk and starting to get totally flipped out on the HARD JAZZ, ticcing and shouting with abandon, self-consciousness gone because it seems to egg on the band... BILLY ROSE: in the door. A young dude leaning in to whisper to him but Billy’s eyes are LOCKED ON-- LIONEL and LAURA, leaning together drinking and laughing. BILLY whispering back to the guy and indicating... Suddenly the guy is at Laura’s elbow pulling on her and whispering. Lionel is too into the music to notice...he’s on his feet and jerking spasmodically...but LAURA is having none of it. She knows this guy and is telling him to beat it. SONG ENDS to clapping and shouts. LIONEL hooting and whistling. THE TRUMPET PLAYER is picking up the vibe off Laura and intervenes on the mic.... Pink Revisions 89.
C: TRUMPET
D: Uh oh, there’s my favorite baby girl, looking pretty as a Rose...
N: Everybody looks over and this makes the GUY back off Laura, who shakes his hand off her arm hard. BILLY, his eyes fierce on Lionel and jaw tight. LAURA GRABS a clueless LIONEL and pulls him on the floor to dance...TRUMPET PLAYER gets her cue... TRUMPET (cont’d) (CONT’D) This one’s for you Laura... He slides into the SLOW SAD THEME WE HEARD AFTER MINNA DIED...and Laura steps up to Lionel, other couples standing with them. LIONEL is immediately uncomfortable with being up in front of people in the suddenly intimate and quiet moment. He starts to twitch and whispers to her urgently
C: LIONEL
D: This isn’t a good idea. I don’t think I can do this.
N: LAURA’s focus comes back to him and she realizes he’s in real distress. She smiles as if to say ‘It’s okay’ but his twitches and suppresses a shout. She instinctively touches the back of his neck sympathetically. To his surprise, her touch settles him, he breathes easier and dances with her, holding still... BILLY whispers urgently, angry to two more YOUNG CATS who nod. They dance slow until the song ends...it can’t last forever. The crowd claps as Lionel stares at her not wanting to let go but she’s seeing something over his shoulder and she touches his face a second and then, annoyed, breaks away...
C: TRUMPET
D: Don’t get too cozy. That was your last break.
N: He snaps and the band counts off into the hot chaotic “Jump Monk”. INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB LIONEL SPINS and gets SWEPT INTO THE MUSIC AGAIN Pink Revisions 90. JUMP CUT: LIONEL HAS LOST HIS JACKET, HIS TIE IS LOOSE AND HE’S IN A FRENZY. SCATTING AND BOPPING WITH THE BAND, DRUNK and HAPPY. THE PLAYERS ARE DOING A CALL AND RESPONSE WITH HIS CRAZY TOURETTIC SHOUTS... ...AND THEN SUDDENLY SOMEONE HAS HIM BY THE COLLAR. HE TURNS TO LOOK FOR LAURA BUT SHE’S GONE and he is being BUM RUSHED OUT THE BACK AND INTO... EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT ...where he gets THROWN DOWN HARD. THREE YOUNG GUYS looming over him. One gives him a good kick to the ribs. LIONEL’S on the ground looking up, woozy and short of breath. BILLY’S THERE...looking down on him. Billy grabs him up by the collar, USING ONLY HIS LEFT ARM...THE RIGHT HANGING LIMP.
C: BILLY
D: You think I don’t know who you work for, cracker?
C: LIONEL
D: You got it wrong--Scaredy Cat! Cracker Jack! Blackie Black!
N: This pisses Billy off even more...He hauls Lionel up harder with his one powerful arm.
C: BILLY
D: I made it through Iwo Jima, motherfucker! You think your boss scares me? You tell him I see any you suits round her again I’ll kill you one at a time, then I’ll mail what he’s lookin’ for to the Post for free!
N: His guys start pulling him off...freaked out a bit. POV: from down the alley around the edge of a corner, someone is watching Billy and his boys over Lionel...and listening... LIONEL’S POV: drunk and blurry, BILLY leaning over BILLY (cont’d) (CONT’D) YOU HEAR ME! I’M GONNA MAIL IT TO THE POST!! Pink Revisions 91. LIONEL’S POV: on his back looking up at fire escape...voices “C’mon Billy...”. His gaze falls sideways into the alley where, blurry, a silhouetted figure seems to be watching. In the backlight the edge of a scarf blows, then is gone. EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - BACK ALLEY - LATER SOUND OF FEET, shuffling. A match...someone snorts and spits. LIONEL’s POV: fading in...woozy....the TRUMPET PLAYER sitting over him, smoking...something in his hand.
C: LIONEL
D: Help...Hep! Hep!
C: TRUMPET
E: laughs
D: You was pretty hep in there my man.
N: Lionel is out of control...can’t stop jerking, agonizing. C.U.- In the Trumpet Player’s hand is a pipe...he was prepping a smoke of something...something more than weed. Lionel fixates on it...reaching for it... TRUMPET (cont’d) (CONT’D) Your head need fixin’? Lionel nods. Trumpet hands it to him and lights a match. He leans in, inhales and The FLAME BLOOMS IN LIONEL’s FACE and as a TRUMPET STARTS UP, everything GOES GOLDEN and we FADE INTO.... EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - LIONEL'S DREAM THE GEOMETRIC PATTERNS OF THE WIRES AND TOWERS ABOVE... A FIGURE, walking away into the backlit arch of the bridge...he turns...it’s MINNA.
C: MINNA
E: cryptic
D: Remember what I said.
N: A final wistful sad smile and then the sun rises behind him turning him into a dark silhouette that resolves into... Pink Revisions 92. INT. TRUMPET PLAYER’S APARTMENT - HARLEM - MORNING SUNLIGHT BEHIND A SMOOTH HEAD. A trumpet playing soft...noodling around a melody. LIONEL’s EYES blinking at...Minna!? He wakes up...and sits up and the MUSIC STOPS. He looks over at... THE TRUMPET PLAYER...sitting in the window sill by the fire escape, watching him and smoking a joint. After a beat...
C: LIONEL
D: Shit...sorry. I don’t even know what happened.
C: TRUMPET
D: You had a good time, that’s what happened. We had a party. Different mix of people than the usual. The ‘etrange melange’ she calls it.
N: Lionel’s eyes flick to the kitchen where the French girlfriend is making coffee.
C: TRUMPET
E: CONT’D
D: Figured you could use a little rest so we let you be.
C: LIONEL
D: I remember that guy’s footprint on my ribs. Thanks for bailing me out of there.
C: TRUMPET
D: Sarge is a good man...but you gotta watch it round a man’s family...you know?
C: LIONEL
D: Sarge?
C: TRUMPET
D: Billy.
C: LIONEL
D: Why you call him ‘Sarge’?
C: TRUMPET
E: MORE
D: How you think his arm got so fucked up? Colored Marine unit. Carrying ammo ‘til he picked up a gun and helped stop some Jap suicide attack. Got hit though.
N: Pink Revisions 93.
C: TRUMPET
E: CONT'D
D: Damn shame too cause he could really play. Trombone. Jammed with us at Minton’s a lot in ‘40. Came back from the war sour as hell. I told him switch to trumpet...said I’d get him a left-hander made. Said he lost his mojo. Got himself a club.
N: Lionel’s head is clearing...he’s remembering and wants to know things...
C: LIONEL
D: You ever meet his wife?
C: TRUMPET
D: Nah, Sarge never married.
C: LIONEL
D: Laura’s mother...?
C: TRUMPET
E: beat - regards him
D: I don’t know about any of that. It was always just him and Laura, she was just a little thing hanging out in the kitchen and reading while we played. You play?
C: LIONEL
D: Music? No.
C: TRUMPET
D: I’m not to keen on people being vocal while we playing, but you were scatting on the line. I could hear it.
C: LIONEL
E: twitches bad
D: On the line, Lionel! Lionel’s on the line! Shit. I’m sorry about that. I have something wrong with my head. The music really set it off. I’m sorry.
C: TRUMPET
E: MORE
D: Don’t be sorry. You got a head just like mine. Always boiling over, turning things around. That’s music...runs you more’n you run it when it gets up in you.
N: Pink Revisions 94.
C: TRUMPET
E: CONT'D
D: Some people call it a gift but it’s a brain affliction just the same.
C: LIONEL
D: Yeah, but I just twitch and shout. At least you got a horn to push it through, make it sound pretty.
C: TRUMPET
D: Yeah but there’s a lotta other hours in the day though, you know what I’m sayin’? Too many!
N: He tokes. Lionel nods and they let that understanding sit between them. Lionel stands and scribbles a number on a matchbook.
C: LIONEL
D: Thanks for helping me out. You ever need a ride anywhere or help with anything, give me a call.
N: TRUMPET PLAYER takes it and nods as Lionel exits. EXT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - DAY Lionel is heading across the street to the steps when he sees...Gabby Horowitz...coming down them. He stops...
C: LIONEL
D: Mrs. Horowitz...?
N: She looks up...he extends his hand. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Jacob Gleason, reporter with the Post... She looks at him quizzically
C: GABBY
D: I know Jake Gleason, you’re not...
N: Caught, he switches it up mid-sentence...
C: LIONEL
E: extends a hand
D: Sorry, Jake, brought me to the Hamilton Housing hearing.
N: Pink Revisions 95.
C: LIONEL
E: CONT'D
D: I’m a new writer for the Times and I’m very interested in this story.
N: She shakes his hand...not totally convinced yet. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) I met your secr-- your aide, Laura Rose. Rose is a rose! She gave me a very illuminating tour of what’s going on in Ft. Greene. I wanted to follow up with her... This piques Gabby’s interest...
C: GABBY
D: Really. I thought being the press office for the Borough Authority was more the business of the Times than exposing them. Seeing as your publisher is an investor in the bank that gets to float the Authority’s bonds at preferred rates.
N: Lionel is flummoxed. Smiles big...
C: LIONEL
D: I’m not saying I can get it A-1 but if I don’t do the legwork, I can’t try can I?
N: This seems to impress her enough...
C: GABBY
D: Well, someone’s going to win a Pulitzer off Title 1, so maybe it’ll be you.
C: LIONEL
D: IF!
C: GABBY
D: Yes, it’s a big ‘if’. Laura’s gone ahead to the protest, you can come with me if you want.
N: She looks at him and as they walk to the curb we CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY ON THE CURB: GABBY’S CAR pulls up to where Laura and another staff member stand waiting. Gabby jumps out and Laura grabs her hand Pink Revisions 96.
C: GABBY
D: I brought the New York Times!
N: But they leave Lionel behind and we rush with them across and through the center of the Arch, revealing REFORMER #2 speaking to the crowd of a large protest. Hundreds have gathered: placards, real citizens of every stripe out in force, energized and angry. The Reformer is warming up the crowd for Gabby.
C: REFORMER #2
D: I want you to give it up for our next speaker. She wears granny glasses but don’t be fooled! She is a PIT BULL for the people! And she taught me more about fighting the good fight than anyone. Let’s not mince words because the moment we are living in calls for naming things as they are! This is not a program of slum removal, it is a program of Negro removal! Now let’s hear from Gabby Horowitz!
N: The crowd takes up a chant: ‘Relocate Randolph!’ CLOSE ON: Lionel sliding into a spot at the back of the crowd. He scans the scene... LIONEL POV: Laura handing Gabby notes as she gets ready; some men around the edges who seem to be photographing the crowd; and Paul: standing back in the fringes, clapping as Gabby steps up to the podium to cheers
C: GABBY
D: What is a City? Is it a place where people slave for the Lords of steel and concrete? A corral for the Druids of Finance to fleece mankind in? NO! The City is its people, it is its Communities! The City is built to serve US!
N: Lionel’s gaze shifts past her to: THE BIG BLACK BA-1 CAR: sliding innocuously in to park on the curb beyond the trees. GABBY (cont’d) (CONT’D) Who’s going to stand up for the City?! (crowd roars “We Are!”) (MORE) Pink Revisions 97. GABBY (cont’d) (CONT’D) Who’s going to remind the politicians and the power brokers and the profiteers that the City belongs to the PEOPLE who live in it?! The CROWD ROARS...and we CUT TO: INT. MOSES’S BLACK CAR/EXT. WASHINGTON SQ PARK - SAME Lieberman and Moses Randolph sit in the back seat, watching as they talk...
C: LIEBERMAN
D: We may have an issue with our friend from Brooklyn.
C: RANDOLPH
D: How so?
C: LIEBERMAN
D: He’s not here for this meshugas, he’s not that brave...but he still might not go along with the vote. Says his constituency is up in arms...
C: RANDOLPH
D: We made him Borough President, we put him on the Board of Estimate. We're his constituency. Don't tell me he won't go along...
N: He pulls a file out of the valise the Aide gave him and hands it over to Lieberman, casually as a man hands over a Kleenex. RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D) Show him that the day before the vote. He’ll go along. He’s a louse. Sound of the CROWD, ROARING... RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D) (smiling at it) I’ve never seen so much horseshit in my life. The he starts to really laugh... Pink Revisions 98. RANDOLPH POV: from inside the car we can see that the crowd has hoisted an effigy of a man with a sign saying “Moses Randolph” hung on its neck and they are setting it to flame.
C: RANDOLPH
E: CONT’D
D: Let’s go have lunch.
N: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER The protest is over, Lionel pushes through crowd by the marble arch...
C: LAURA
E: O.S.
D: Jake! Hey Jake!!
N: She enters chasing him and grabs his arm...he turns
C: LIONEL
D: Ah the disappearing lady...
C: LAURA
D: I’m so sorry...I own you an explanation..
C: LIONEL
D: Nah, you don’t owe me nothing. I’m used to it.
C: LAURA
D: No I want to explain.
N: From O.S., Gabby yells for her
C: LIONEL
D: You gotta go.
C: LAURA
D: I’ll be up at the club tonight later. Meet me there.
C: LIONEL
D: I’ll see if I can
C: LAURA
D: Come.
N: Gabby calls again and she hustles off, Lionel watches her a beat. Then catches sight of someone and rushes out after... PAUL: shambling away, pulling up his thin coat against the cold. Lionel hustles up from behind to catch up with him. Pink Revisions 99. Paul perceives him and, after a moment of fear, realizes who it is... (as before Paul’s speech is like a fire-hose, a manic blitz of information)
C: PAUL
D: The reporter who never reports...
C: LIONEL
D: I’m still putting the pieces together.
C: PAUL
D: You need me to write it for you? Jeez you’re not too ambitious are you? Okay here’s your next headline: “New Expressway Will be the World’s Biggest Parking Lot.”
C: LIONEL
D: Why?
C: PAUL
D: Because cars are a cancer and roads make them metastasize not shrink. We need trains but he’s killing the trains.
C: LIONEL
D: Why?
C: PAUL
D: Always with the ‘why?’ Because he doesn’t control the revenue from trains, he controls the tolls on bridges and roads. Borough Authority. You know what an Authority is? Neither did anybody else. He invented it. A 4th branch of government...a shadow branch... with independent revenue that is the only reliable financing for public works, all controlled by him meaning he controls everything and yet nobody ever voted for him and they can’t vote him out.
C: LIONEL
D: What could stop him?
C: PAUL
D: Almost nothing. And he’s more dangerous now than ever.
N: Pink Revisions 100.
C: LIONEL
D: Why now?
C: PAUL
E: stops and turns
D: Because the Board of Estimate votes on his highway and slum clearance plans this week! So he’s breaking out all his dirt on people. Bullying everyone into submission. He is the most powerful person in the history of this City! He is a autocratic Caesar. And nobody realizes it. They’re all walking around calm as Hindu cows, thinking they live in a Democracy so what could go wrong?. Now are you going to write it or what?!
C: LIONEL
D: If you’ve got the goods why don’t you take him down?
C: PAUL
E: snapping
D: ‘Cause it can’t be me!
C: LIONEL
D: Cause you’re his brother?
N: This is the first thing that stops Paul’s torrent and makes him look stricken and vulnerable...
C: PAUL
E: whispering - paranoid
D: ‘Cause I’ve still got dreams. That’s why. Dreams I’m this close to realizing. My contribution to society...my legacy! I won’t risk it. Okay here, look at Belmont Developers and Inwood Residential.
C: LIONEL
D: What’s that?
C: PAUL
E: sharp-resentful
D: Christ, I’m giving you the goods! A map to the scoop of the decade...Do your own damn job! Do the job! I got enough problems...
N: Pink Revisions 101. And with that he’s leaving...waving off Lionel and muttering to himself...and we CUT TO: INT. THE NEW YORK HALL OF RECORDS - CLERK’S DESK - LATER SAME DAY A CLERK leads Lionel to an open table where he puts down a big metal file of records...Lionel moves to slide it toward a chair but the Clerk stops him.
C: CLERK
D: Oh sorry, I’ll need your name and social security number.
C: LIONEL
D: I’m not checking it out, I’m gonna look at it right here...
C: CLERK
D: Sure, yeah...but, um...see... parties wishing to review incorporation materials of city contractors have to register with Construction Commissioner’s office.
C: LIONEL
D: That can’t be legal. Eagle! Beagle! Bagel!
C: CLERK
D: Not really a law, more of a rule, Mr....
N: Lionel hands over the NY POST PRESS PASS of Jake Gleason.
C: LIONEL
D: Gleason.
N: INT. THE NEW YORK HALL OF RECORDS - LATER Lionel sits at the table with the documents, poring through them. CLOSE ON: documents of incorporation for “Belmont Developers”, “Inwood Residential Services”...applications for City contracts... Details captured as Lionel writes in his notebook: the companies were incorporated in 1952; prior contracts with city - NONE; references of note - NONE; Pink Revisions 102. Then he sees: Officers: WILLIAM LIEBERMAN, GEORGE SPAULDING, TOM BROOKS. Both companies...SAME NAMES, SAME PARTNERS He double checks it in disbelief:
C: LIONEL
E: getting worked up
D: IF! IF!
N: He tries to muffle it but he looks up and the CLERK is scowling at him and we CUT TO: EXT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - NIGHT The early evening dark of winter. LIONEL hustles to the door. INT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - CONTINUOUS A tiny single room with a single reception desk. Absurdly spare. A LONE SECRETARY who looks up from a book.
C: SECRETARY
D: May I help you?
C: LIONEL
D: You have the applications for relocation?
C: SECRETARY
D: Yeah, just there!
N: She points at a huge stack on the counter to his left.
C: LIONEL
D: And I can mail those in?
C: SECRETARY
D: In person applications only, just there.
N: She points again at an even bigger pile...two or three boxes of completed forms against a wall.
C: LIONEL
D: So they have you running this whole operation all by yourself, do they?
N: She smiles flirtatiously and drops her book revealing a tight pink sweater and Vargas girl rack... Pink Revisions 103.
C: LIONEL
E: CONT’D
E: sighs
D: PINK TITS! You have a good evening.
N: He leaves. Disappointed she watches him go. EXT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - A FEW MINUTES LATER Lionel watches as... THE SECRETARY opens the door, braces it open, hauls out a box, closes the door and locks it. She then hefts the box, walks over to a bunch of trash cans and lifts the metal lid and tips the box in. She dusts her hands and walks off for the night. LIONEL HUSTLES ACROSS THE STREET, straight to the cans. He opens the lid and the clang of it echoes in the dark. He reaches in and pulls up...a handful of the forms. He seizes a few to hold up into the light and examine when the SCRAPE OF A SHOE IN GRAVEL makes him turn into... The FLASH of movement of an ARM....THONK. LIONEL’s POV: the world spins upward as he goes down and we can hear him groan...backlit by the street lamp, figure in a hat leans down...LOU bending over him, the leather sap still in his hand.
C: LOU
D: People’s trash remains private property until its collected. Anybody ever tell you that?
N: Behind the smaller man...THE GIANT STEPS INTO VIEW, looming almost out of frame... LOU (cont’d) (CONT’D) I think we’ve seen each other before, ain’t we? (to the Giant) Ain’t we? The GIANT NODS. Sounds: a match. Flames whoosh OS, lighting LOU’s face, as the Giant burns the evidence. LOU (cont’d) (CONT’D) Keep sticking your nose in people’s trash and we’ll be seeing each other again. They step out of frame and the streetlight FLARES in our eyes and we hear their footsteps start away when... Pink Revisions 104.
C: LIONEL
E: O.S.

N: The footsteps stop and start back... LIONEL (O.S.) (cont’d) (CONT’D) Goddam it... LOU leans in again...closer
C: LOU
D: Jeez, I was told to go easy and I did. But now you made me go and do this.
N: HIS FOOT rises up and comes down into our face with a nasty CRACKING THUD. BLACK. And then we FADE UP INTO: INT. THE L&L OFFICE - NIGHT LIONEL is holding an ice bag against the back of his head and has a bruise starting to color under one eye. He’s going over it all with TONY...CONEY and DANNY listen and try to follow.
C: LIONEL
D: They’re not even pretending, they’re just collecting the checks and then throwing these people’s lives in the trash. These guys make Tammany look like AA ball, I’m telling you.
C: CONEY
D: We coulda used youse in Korea, Lionel...
C: LIONEL
D: Why’s that?
C: CONEY
D: Cause ya talk Chinese better’n half the chinks in the city...
C: LIONEL
D: Chinky, Chunky Chowder! Go to hell, Coney. Lunk-a-loaf, Beef Brain!
N: Coney laughs and looks at Tony like “Am I right?” But Tony is not paying attention to Lionel’s tics for once... Pink Revisions 105.
C: TONY
E: to Lionel
D: Go get him an aspirin, Gil... Coney folds a straight if the cards aren’t all the same color. Don’t pay no attention to him. Look, people cut deals with the pols for contracts, what else is new? Kicking up the chain, it’s the nature of things...
C: LIONEL
D: They’re not making deals with politicians, they’re making deals with themselves! They own the companies they’re giving contracts to! It ain’t kickbacks, it’s Grand Larceny... Land a Farce on me! Don’t fart on my land, Man!
N: He’s really wound up, twitching bad.
C: TONY
E: to Danny
D: Calm down... You got any weed? Give ‘im a smoke.
N: Danny pulls a joint out and starts it up hands it to Lionel who goes ahead and takes a deep pull.
C: LIONEL
D: Minna said this was the biggest gravy train of the century and it all goes down in two days.
C: DANNY
D: Okay...so it’s big stuff but how was Frank mixed up in it?
C: LIONEL
D: Every one of the officers of the Borough Authority is gonna make millions on this deal. But none of it ties to him.

C: LIONEL
D: To Randolph!
N: Pink Revisions 106.
C: TONY
E: incredulous
D: The Parks Commissioner?
C: LIONEL
D: It’s all about him. The girl has the line on the scam, she’s been digging into those companies for Horowitz. I think she found something that ties Randolph right to the money. Frank was following her and he figured it out and he took it in to Lieberman and his goons and showed em he had a signature. I’m telling you, Frank had something that nails Randolph.
N: The guys look unsure.
C: LIONEL
E: CONT’D
D: C’mon! Where did we lose em? On the Borough Bridge, for chrissake! They had a pass! Those guys were BA! The Borough Authority killed Frank!
N: Worked up and exhausted, he sucks hard on the joint. Tony is listening very attentively to him...
C: TONY
D: Alright...alright, calm down. Fuckin’ Lionel...I think you’re on the sniff. I do. But what’s the angle on the guy at the club? Her father. What was Frank doing talking to him?
C: LIONEL
D: I got no idea...part makes no sense to me. But he knows something.
N: Tony nods.
C: TONY
D: Go home. Let me do some calling around.
N: Lionel looks at him...confused...getting high...
C: LIONEL
D: Who you gonna call?
N: Pink Revisions 107.
C: TONY
D: Will you just trust me and let me run with it?
N: Lionel doesn’t know what that means but he’s too stoned now to sort it. He nods. INT. LIONEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT Lionel enters, stoned and sore.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Frank was the only person I knew who thought the way we won the war was gonna cause us problems. He said after the Crash we were digging ourselves out by taking care of each other. But now that we’d seen what we could do with our brute strength, there was no going back. He said ‘From here on out, the game’s gonna be about Power, from top to bottom.’
N: TIGHT ON: Minna’s hat, as he hangs it on the wall next to his own He flops on the bed and the cat appears and he strokes it. He has just closed his eyes when the RINGING PHONE JOLTS HIM LIKE A SHOCK. He answers it...

C: BILLY’S VOICE

KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT Lionel pauses at the opening of the alley, checks around him when...BANG!...a muffled report snaps his head around. Was that a shot?

BILLY ROSE IS DEAD IN THE CHAIR...blood running down his white shirt from a gunshot wound through the chest and a belt tied around his chest to hold himself up. A suicide? LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Ah shit... Then he stops cold, hairs on his neck rising...THE GUN IS HANGING IN BILLY’S USELESS RIGHT HAND. LIONEL RIPS HIS GUN OUT, SPINS TOWARD THE FRONT.

C: LIONEL
D: The gun’s in his right hand.
C: DETECTIVE
D: So.
C: LIONEL
D: He’s got a dead right arm, ace. War wound. He can’t lift a Zippo with it let alone a .38. You wanna show me how he shot himself in the heart with his left hand and then handed it off to his right before he punched out?
C: DETECTIVE
D: Guy went out in his own joint, center stage with the lights and all. Gotta give him credit. I respect his style.
N: THE BODY IS BEING BROUGHT OUT ON A STRETCHER. Lionel glances at the COP, something not right...
C: LIONEL
D: They usually put Division dicks on dawn patrol in Harlem?
C: DETECTIVE
D: Oh, we go wherever we’re needed. We done?
N: He winks as over his shoulder LIONEL sees... LAURA RUNNING DOWN THE SIDEWALK. HE SPRINTS TOWARD HER TO STOP HER... Pink Revisions 111.
C: LAURA
D: Oh no...Oh NOOOOO!
N: She pushes past him to Billy’s body, distraught. WIDE: the sad tableau of her bent over BILLY’S BODY with Lionel hanging behind...and music floats in as we CUT TO: INT. LAURA’S HALLWAY / APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT He escorts her up the stairs of the tenement apartment to her door. She inserts the key but stops with her hand on it. Her head falls and she starts weeping. He reaches down gently and pulls her hand off the key, turns it himself and opens the door. She stands in the doorway with tears falling silently down her face.
C: LAURA
D: I can’t think of the last time I saw him smile...But...why would he do that...to himself...?
N: Her voice breaks...he lifts her face up...
C: LIONEL
D: He didn’t. Someone wanted it to look that way.
N: She shakes her head...
C: LAURA
D: Man was angry as long as I can remember. But nobody hated him like that...nobody.
N: He reflexively touches her shoulder three times in a row. She accepts it...too upset to care. LAURA (cont’d) (CONT’D) Who would do such a thing?
C: LIONEL
D: Same people did it to a friend of mine.
N: She looks up, confused...but too sad to try to understand. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) You got somebody you can call? She shakes her head and weeps... Pink Revisions 112. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) You’re all alone?
C: LAURA
D: You got no idea...
N: She weeps. He kisses her forehead but pulls back, awkward. LAURA (cont’d) (CONT’D) Could you...stay with me a while?
C: LIONEL
D: You want me to?
N: She nods and we...FADE TO: INT. LAURA’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING WIDE ON THE ROOM: In the spill of morning light, Laura is asleep on her side on the bed, facing us, with Lionel’s coat draped over her. Lionel has fallen asleep in his clothes, beside her, awkwardly against the headboard. TWO SHOT ON THE BED: as Laura wakes with a sharp inhale and turns over staring at the ceiling, processing that it’s all real, numb. Realizing Lionel is still there, she sits up slightly next to him...Her movement brings him awake and he’s immediately uncomfortable about having fallen asleep next to her.
C: LIONEL
D: IF! Ah, sorry... I don’t know what happened...didn’t mean to fall asleep. Sorry.
C: LAURA
D: It’s okay...I appreciate you staying.
C: LIONEL
D: Listen, I know how you’re feeling, I really do. Pretty soon you’re gonna hear his voice in your head telling you to pull yourself together and get moving. And when you do, you’ll feel him smiling again.
N: This triggers her and she weeps. He sits with it until she recovers.
C: LAURA
D: Why you being so nice to me?
N: Pink Revisions 113.
C: LIONEL
D: Cause I think you’re a good person. You actually care about what happens to other people. And you try to make a difference. That’s a good way to be.
C: LAURA
D: You’re sweet.
N: She takes his hand, winds her fingers into his.
C: LIONEL
D: Well, that isn’t how most people describe me when they meet me, but I’m glad if you think so. IF!
C: LAURA
E: smiles
D: Anybody ever told you you talk in your sleep?
C: LIONEL
D: I never slept with anybody.
C: LAURA
D: You never slept with anybody?
C: LIONEL
D: I been with girls...just, not the kind that stay to sleep.
N: She’s touched by the loneliness in this
C: LAURA
D: Who’s Frank?
N: His expression changes...a little suspicious
C: LIONEL
D: What?
C: LAURA
E: realizes
D: You said that name in your sleep. You seemed...upset. Was he your friend who got...?
N: Lionel nods...She looks at him, searching...
C: LIONEL
E: MORE
D: I worked with him...I worked for him. I knew him since I was 12. I was at that Catholic Home for Boys on DeKalb.
N: Pink Revisions 114.
C: LIONEL
E: CONT'D
D: They threw me in there when I was 6, after my mother died. Frank kinda..took me under his wing.
N: She absorbs this... LIONEL (CONT’D) (cont’d) He never called me by my name. He called me “Brooklyn”. He’d say ‘Look at you, Motherless Brooklyn. Got no one looking out for you.’
C: LAURA
D: We all need someone looking out for us.
N: She kisses him softly, lingering a second. She rolls off the bed and out of frame...He watches her go, affected by her. ANGLE ON: a PHOTO IN A FRAME on the shelf near the bed...A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a 20’s-style dress, smiling. Her skin very dark, eyes white and shining...happy. Holding a LITTLE BABY, wrapped up.
C: LIONEL
E: off her nod
D: That your mother? She was beautiful.
C: LAURA
D: She died a long time ago. I don’t remember her. I guess we both got nobody now.
N: He studies her...
C: LIONEL
D: Listen...I gotta ask you... Are you holding something out?
C: LAURA
D: What?
C: LIONEL
D: On Hamilton...you and Horowitz. These BA goons are scared of something big. Something that ties all this fraud you been digging around right to the top man. Do you know what it is?
N: She sits up...brain spinning Pink Revisions 115.
C: LAURA
D: No...I mean, somebody’s getting rich but...no...
C: LIONEL
D: If you’re holding some card and you’re waiting to play it to block that vote, you’re playing a dangerous game. They already killed Frank and your father for it...
C: LAURA
D: What’s Billy got to do with it?
C: LIONEL
D: Billy knew something about it. He and my friend together...
C: LAURA
E: totally perplexed
D: That’s not possible...he doesn’t even...he didn’t even know what I’m working on. I got an uncle knows Gabby that got me that job.
C: LIONEL
E: shakes his head
D: No, and my name’s not Jake,it’s Lionel...look...Frank was an investigator. They hired him to keep tabs on your committee. He was following you. I started poking around it to figure out who did to him, now...I’ve just got glass in my brain. I don’t even know what I’m after.
N: She seems thrown. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) I’m sorry for lying to ya but believe me, you gotta take this seriously. Can you stay around here today?
C: LAURA
E: flustered
D: Gabby’s expecting me. We’re preparing her testimony before the vote...it’s important but...
N: Pink Revisions 116.
C: LAURA
E: CONT'D
D: I need to make arrangements, a funeral...
C: LIONEL
D: All that can wait cause if I’m right the Coroner’s office won’t release the body to you yet. Get one of the guys from the club to take you down there. Then stay around people you know until I come and get you, alright?
N: She nods, fearful. THE SIZZLE AND POP OF AN EDGY RIFF COMES UP AND WE CUT TO: EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING Lionel exits her building and immediately LARGE MEN ARE ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM, plucking the GUN from his holster before he can even make a move, MOVING HIM TOWARD A CAR. NOT COPS...but they have that familiar PIN on their lapels...and, like MINNA on the day he was killed, Lionel is pushed INTO A BLACK CAR AND AWAY IT GOES...as we CUT TO: EXT. BOROUGH AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS - MORNING LIONEL is escorted in. INT BOROUGH AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS - WAITING ROOM - CONT Lionel stands in the antechamber of an office off a grand lobby...every detail says that this is the SEAT of POWER. The two MUSCLES IN SUITS stand totally silent blocking the exit. Not threatening...just there. Impassive. THE INNER DOOR OPENS REVEALING: William Lieberman. He looks at Lionel with the cold scrutiny of a practiced strategist, sizing him up. Then he nods and opens the door wider nodding Lionel into... INT. MOSES RANDOLPH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Big. A commanding view of the East River on both sides, flowing around the island on which they sit, under the Triborough Bridge which can be seen looming above as well. The office of a kingpin... Pink Revisions 117. In the center is a massive table with a model of the whole of New York’s FIVE BOROUGHS...the pieces all movable. Bridges and elevated highways and huge apartment towers all placed...infrastructure that will not exist for more than a decade...a glimpse of New York City in the future... ...and on the other end of the room, waiting by his desk with his arms crossed is Moses Randolph. He looks up as Lionel enters, gestures that he come join him by the MODEL OF THE CITY. Without a word, Lieberman slides to a chair on the periphery and lights a cigarette, which he smokes through the scene, languid and cool. RANDOLPH stands regarding Lionel who nervously hides his small tics in fake adjustments of his neck such...
C: RANDOLPH
D: You know who I am?
C: LIONEL
D: I been asking around about that but everybody seems to have a different answer.
N: RANDOLPH laughs loud and sharp.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Ha! Spoken like a true snoop!
N: His loud laugh makes Lionel ‘YELP’ involuntarily but he hides it as a sneeze. Now Randolph is smiling big and we see what a magnetic presence he can have. An Emperor in a good mood...
C: LIONEL
D: What’s your take on it?
C: RANDOLPH
E: beat
D: Easy. I’m a builder.
N: Lionel looks at the enormous model of the City...
C: LIONEL
D: I can see that...
N: Randolph references Manhattan island... Pink Revisions 118.
C: RANDOLPH
E: he puts a finger on..
D: When I was a boy you know how many bridges there were on and off Manhattan Island? Two. A shitty old train trestle here and... The Brooklyn Bridge. And when you walked across that you were stepping in horse dung most of the way. You mostly scuttled into New York off a dock...like a rat. I built that...
C: LIONEL
D: They’re nice bridges, I’ll give you that.
N: Randolph turns to him with a smile.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Thank you. And I want you to give me something else...if you find it. Have you found it?
N: There’s no smile in this. Lionel answers with a question.
C: LIONEL
D: What’s in it?
C: RANDOLPH
D: Slander. Falsehood. Forgery, most likely.
C: LIONEL
D: Then you got nothing to worry about, the law’s on your side.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Very little that I have achieved in my life has relied on legality. I don’t intend to lean on that slender branch now when things matter most.
C: LIONEL
D: You’re above the law?
C: RANDOLPH
D: No, no...I’m ahead of it.
N: Pink Revisions 119.
C: LIONEL
D: What’s the difference?
N: Randolph looks at his vision of the City...
C: RANDOLPH
D: Law’s just a rule book we make for the world we find ourselves in. You rebuild a city, you have to push ahead into a new world that most people can’t even envision yet... then the law follows along and adapts to what you’ve done.
C: LIONEL
D: Who you rebuilding it for?
C: RANDOLPH
E: obviously
D: The future. The people to come.
C: LIONEL
D: Sounds great unless you’re a person who’s in the way now.
N: Randolph laughs and points at the City map...
C: RANDOLPH
E: MORE
D: Central Park: Greatest urban park in the world. They started building it when there wasn’t even a city past 57th St. They kicked out farmers and tenant squatters, sheep herders out of muddy fields and filth. They moved some trees. And people protested the loss of goddam ‘countryside’. But if one man hadn’t been able to SEE AHEAD to what we’d need, this city’d be unlivable today, wouldn’t it? Yes it would.
N: Pink Revisions 120.
C: RANDOLPH
E: CONT'D
E: with teeth
D: People don’t even know Fred Olmsted’s name but they should thank him every day. I do. The important thing in life is to Get Things Done. Those who can, build. Those who can't, criticize. But I won’t obstruct the great work of the world because some chipmunks start screeching about having to relocate their nuts.
N: Those words are more than Lionel’s head can take..
C: LIONEL
D: Screech-a-munk-nut-chip!
N: His arm SNAPS out twice with this exclamation... Lieberman pauses mid-smoke...his eyes widening... Randolph stares at Lionel, measuring this... He seems to grasp that this is an affliction...not an offense. He puts a hand on Lionel’s shoulder with fatherly aspect, towering over him...pulling him into this vision...
C: RANDOLPH
D: Talent and brains get rewarded in this building, Lionel. Work with us on this and I’ll see to it personally that your gifts are appreciated.
N: He exhales smoke. RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D) (without turning) But that’s the offer today. Let us know where you stand by tonight. He turns and walks to the window. Meeting over. INT BA HEADQUARTERS - WAITING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER Lieberman escorts Lionel out to his two ‘body men’ and nods. They hand him back FRANK’S GUN. As Lionel holsters it. Lieberman regards Lionel curiously...
C: LIEBERMAN
D: It’s funny...We read it wrong.
N: Pink Revisions 121.
C: LIONEL
D: How’s that?
C: LIEBERMAN
D: We didn’t make you for the Ace in Minna’s deck.
N: He nods at the two BIG MEN and turns away. Lionel processes that as THE BIG DOOR CLOSES and we CUT TO: EXT. NEW YORK SKYLINE Seen from across the river...an impossible dark maze. INT. THE L&L OFFICE - AFTERNOON Lionel storms in and DANNY looks up as he goes over to his desk.

C: LIONEL
D: There’s a loose thread, Danny. It’s making my brain hurt...I can’t...
N: He picks up the photos of Laura and Billy, scanning them each again...there are only 4 or 5... He looks up suddenly...to DANNY... LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Where’s the rest? Pink Revisions 122.
C: DANNY

Danny comes after him but Lionel is back out the door, almost hitting Danny with it in his charge to the desk...A SMALL STACK OF PHOTOS IN HIS HAND. He drops them on the desk and starts to scan them.

N: Pink Revisions 124. She shakes her head but clearly he’s hit the mark... LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Don’t shine me! You think I don’t know who that is? Her face registers shock...how could he know...she stammers.. They start overlapping, not hearing each other...

D: Yes, goddam it. Are you in it too...?
C: LAURA
D: No...that’s not my father with my uncle Paul... It’s my Uncle Billy with my father...Paul.
N: He stares at her in shock. LAURA (cont’d) (CONT’D) You remember that picture of my mother? Now look at Billy. Now look at me. (Re: her light skin) You see? Rest of the world might look past me without seeing, but I don’t. They never said so, but it doesn’t take much to put it together. Why else he take such an interest in me? Take care of me when Billy was in the war? Pay for law school when he’s got nothing?
C: LIONEL
D: He’s using you. He’s using you to get back at his brother.
C: LAURA
D: I don’t think he’s got family.
N: Lionel pulls the old newspaper clip....hands it to her. Pink Revisions 125.

C: PAUL
D: Hang on--
C: LIONEL
E: a torrent of accusation
D: It’s you who found whatever they’re scared of. You’ve finally got something bad enough to sink your brother so you gave it to Minna to put it in play cause you thought if you hid behind Frank you could do the damage and still get your engineering plan picked. And you made it look like it came from Laura so you could hide behind her too! But people are getting killed if you didn’t notice!

C: PAUL
E: beat
D: I will NOT discuss such things with you! I knew you weren’t a reporter. Load ‘a shit. You’re Minna’s guy. I’m sorry for you but it was NOT me. Frank put it all together...he and Billy thought they could get something out of it. Foolish greed. I tried to stop them. I told them it would put her at risk. All of them...now look. Frank gets killed, Billy panics and calls me...that’s your picture!
N: Paul looks up, suddenly very concerned... PAUL (cont’d) (CONT’D) You're into something you don't understand. If you just stand up to him on principles, like I did, he'll ruin you for spite.

C: PAUL

D: Yes. I signed it. Billy brought her to our family’s home. Our servants tried to send them away and Billy started yelling. We were at dinner with our mother, for godsake. I followed Mo to the door.

C: LIONEL
D: You confronted him about it.
C: PAUL
E: real hate
D: I begged him. I invoked every principle and value we had been raised to champion. I was...in anguish. You can’t understand...Our whole young life, he was my hero. We wrote our Creed. We were going to fix the world together... but to serve people, you have to love people. Mo tried but he was so brilliant that he resented lesser minds and he became hard. Obsessed with winning and addicted to power. Totally contemptuous of...ideals. This phony 'man of the people’... The Jews call a man who's not what he seems to be an ‘apicoris’. That's a dangerous thing, when people aren't seen for what they really are...a very dangerous thing.

D: It’s the last loose end and it’s outta my hands anyway. Now let’s just have a drink--
N: AND LIONEL FLINGS THE BOILING WATER RIGHT IN HIS FACE. TONY SHOUTS, GRABBING HIS FACE AND LIONEL IS EXPLODING OUT OF THE SEAT AND HEADING FOR THE DOOR BUT TONY LUNGES, KNOCKING OVER THEIR TABLE, SEIZING HIM IN A WRESTLERS TACKLE, SPINNING HIM AROUND AND SLAMMING HIM TO THE FLOOR, CRASHING ON TOP OF HIM AND IMMEDIATELY SEIZING HIS THROAT IN A MURDEROUS CHOKE LIONEL TRIES DESPERATELY TO BREAK HIS HANDS AWAY, THEN GOES FOR THE GUN STRAPPED TO HIM BUT TONY SLAMS HIS KNEE INTO LIONEL’S CHEST, BLOCKING HIM...LIONEL IS GETTING DESPERATE, CLOSE ON: HIS HAND SEARCHING FOR ANYTHING, FINDING THE HEAVY GLASS SUGAR SHAKER ROLLING ON THE GROUND. AND HE BRINGS THE HEAVY GLASS SHAKER UP AGAINST TONY’S TEMPLE...HARD...WITH A NASTY CRUNCH. TONY GOES OVER AND OFF HIM WITH A GRUNT, STUNNED, LIONEL SCRAMBLES TO HIS KNEES AND HITS HIM AGAIN ABOVE THE EYE. AND TONY IS OUT FOR THE COUNT. That’s all the opening Lionel needs. He is up, choking, out the door and into: EXT. STREET BY BAR - NIGHT LIONEL IS SPRINTING, BREATH EXPLODING IN THE COLD AIR. Turning a corner and stopping at...A PAYPHONE. Dialing fast... LIONEL BETTY’S VOICE (O.S.) Laura Rose please...What? I’m sorry she’s gone for the Where’d she go? when? WHEN?! day. Oh, I think she went home. Who is th--? About 15 * minutes ago.

TAXI CAB - SAME MOMENT Lionel leans forward to the cabbie... Pink Revisions 135.
C: LIONEL
D: 149th and St Nicholas. Harlem. Floor it, I got money!
N: INT. SUBWAY CAR/TAXI CAB (INTERCUTTING) - NIGHT Laura moves from one car to another and a MAN seems to be following her. THE CAB, racing uptown, beating a yellow light going red... IN THE TRAIN: an announcement that the train will go no further due to a breakdown. Laura groans and prepares to get out with other passengers LIONEL coming out of his skin in the back. EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT Laura walking in the cold, farther from home than normal EXT./INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS Lionel looking out the window: The KING ROOSTER and LAURA’s BUILDING coming into view POV: Laura a few steps from her corner He cranks the window down and SCREAMS HER NAME, but as he does a LARGE TRUCK passes drowning him out. It clears and she’s rounding the corner, unaware. He’s not going to catch her...He hurls money at the cabbie and leaps out practically still rolling. EXT. STREET / KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS He immediately looks up at: LAURA’S APT WINDOW. A light in the window SUDDENLY GOES OUT. SOMEONE IS WAITING IN HER APARTMENT and Lionel explodes across the street. HIGH-TEMPO MUSIC SNAPS IN...COMING FROM THE CLUB. He hits the sidewalk, past the ROOSTER. The TRUMPET PLAYER looks up from his cigarette at Lionel flying by. EXT. LAURA’S APARTMENT BUILDING / SIDE STREET - NIGHT A car is parked in the shadows across the street. Pink Revisions 136. Over the shoulder of the driver we see LIONEL BURST AROUND THE CORNER...the DRIVER (LOU) reacts in shock
C: LOU
D: Son of a bitch!
N: He piles out of the car, moving into the street as Lionel enters the vestibule and desperately HITS EVERY BUZZER. Someone buzzes him in and as he pushes frantically in and closes the door, he sees something in the reflection and looks back to see LOU: EMERGING FROM SHADOW INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. They lock eyes for a split second before Lionel SLAMS THE DOOR and sprints for the stairs. INT. STAIRWELL OF LAURA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Lionel taking the stairs three at a time, not daring to yell to her but PULLING FRANK’s GUN AS HE RUNS. INT. LAURA’S HALLWAY/APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ON LAURA: reaching her landing and moving to her apartment at the end of the hall to put her key in the lock when the sound of feet coming fast makes her pause and turn... ...AND THERE IS LIONEL ALMOST ON HER, EYES WIDE, GUN OUT She OPENS HER MOUTH TO EXCLAIM...BUT HE’S ON HER, CLAMPING HIS HAND OVER HER MOUTH AND SILENCING HER WITH A GESTURE. HE LOOKS TOWARD HER DOOR...HER EYES GO THERE, NOW TERRIFIED... ...Her hand is still on the key in the lock...gently he puts his hand over hers and carefully, eases her shaking hand off the key THE DOOR JERKS OPEN and THE GIANT LOOMS OVER THEM. LAURA SCREAMS and LIONEL SHOVES HER BACK AND DUCKS, BARELY EVADING THE SWIPE OF A KNIFE THAT SPEARS MINNA’S HAT OFF HIS HEAD AND STICKS INTO THE WOODEN DOOR FRAME LIONEL TRIES TO RAISE FRANK’S .45 BUT THE GIANT’S HUGE HAND TOMAHAWKS DOWN, HITTING LIONEL’S GUN HAND BOOM! THE .45 FIRES STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GIANT’S RIGHT FOOT. HE GRUNTS AND DROPS, SMASHING THE GUN OUT OF LIONEL’S HAND AND TO THE FLOOR AND KNOCKING LIONEL DOWN TOO. Pink Revisions 137. AS LIONEL CRABS BACK, THE GIANT LIFTS FRANK’S GUN AND AIMS POINT BLANK AT LIONEL. LIONEL FLINCHES AND LAURA SCREAMS AS CLICK. THE GUN JAMS. LIONEL IS UP AND MOVING AS THE GIANT TRIES TO WORK THE SLIDE AND FIRE. CLICK. LAURA IS HEADING FOR THE STAIRS BUT LIONEL GRABS HER AND SHOVES HER TOWARD THE END OF THE HALL AS THE GIANT TRIES AGAIN. CLICK. THE GIANT TOSSES THE JAMMED GUN ASIDE AND RISES PAINFULLY, HIS FOOT BLEEDING HEAVILY. HE YANKS HIS KNIFE FROM THE DOORFRAME AND STARTS TO LIMP TOWARD THEM LIONEL IS HURLING OPEN THE WINDOW AT THE END OF THE HALL Laura scrambles out the window onto the fire escape with Lionel right behind her...ONE LAST LOOK AT the GIANT STRIDING TOWARD THEM FASTER. EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS HOT, FAST MUSIC coming from THE ROOSTER nearby...They are 4 STORIES UP on a 5 story building and the FIRE ESCAPE is old and rickety... Laura goes left fast, putting her hand on the railing only to have it BREAK COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE BRICK WALL, ALMOST SENDING HER INTO SPACE. SHE SCREAMS AS LIONEL GRABS HER ARM AND PRACTICALLY THROWS HER UP THE LADDER. JUST AS HE STARTS TO CLIMB BEHIND HER-- SMASH! THE WHOLE WINDOW FRAME EXPLODES IN GLASS AND SPLINTERS AS THE GIANT COMES STRAIGHT THROUGH IT LIKE IT WAS PAPER... LAURA’S SCREAM CUTS THROUGH THE DARK...and the MUSIC JAM STOPS SUDDENLY. Lionel desperately climbs but he’s running into Laura and then A HUGE HAND HAS HIM BY THE ANKLE...HE GRABS THE RAILINGS AND HAULS HIS WHOLE BODY UP AGAINST THE IMMOVABLE WEIGHT...it’s just enough to stretch the Giant’s arm enough that he can’t swing his KNIFE HAND up as high... LIONEL’s ELBOWS are locked around posts of the railing, trying to resist...being pulled down...but it’s too much and HE’S SLIPPING...he DROPS TWO STEPS FAST, CLAWING TO GET A NEW GRIP...but the KNIFE IS MOVING IN when... CRASH! Something HITS the Giant RIGHT IN THE FOREHEAD, OPENING A CUT LIKE A BOXER, AS LIONEL TWISTS AWAY... THE GIANT looks up at...LAURA ON THE PLATFORM ABOVE, HOLDING A SECOND FLOWER POT WHICH SHE THROWS DOWN HARD. Pink Revisions 138. THE GIANT THROWS UP HIS KNIFE HAND TO BLOCK IT BUT THE IMPACT KNOCKS THE KNIFE OUT OF HIS HAND AND AS HIS MOVEMENT STANDS HIM UP A LITTLE TOO STRAIGHT ON THE LADDER... LIONEL PUTS A FOOT AGAINST THE MAN’S CHEST AND KICKS HARD. THE GIANT LURCHES BACK...ARMS PINWHEELING, TIPPING BACK AND CRASHING INTO THE BROKEN RAILING WHICH FLIES OFF THE WALL, PITCHING HIM OUT INTO OPEN SPACE. BUT HIS FLAILING HAND MANAGES TO GRAB THE SILL OF A WINDOW. LAURA: RUNS ACROSS THE PLATFORM ABOVE LIONEL TO THE FAR RAIL AND LOOKS DOWN. FOR A FROZEN SECOND SHE AND THE GIANT LOOK RIGHT AT EACH OTHER...AND THEN HE SILENTLY FALLS, a horrible drop...CRASHING ON HIS BACK ONTO A LOW DIVIDING WALL IN THE ALLEY WITH A SICKENING CRACK. LIONEL appears next to her. He looks down at the broken body, unmoving. Laura is SHAKING HARD. He grabs her shoulders and finds her eyes.
C: LIONEL
D: There’s another one downstairs. Come on...
N: And he starts up the final ladder to the roof... EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - ROOF - CONTINUOUS LIONEL bursts onto the roof and shouts into the dark...
C: LIONEL
D: She doesn’t know! SHE DOESN’T KNOW!
N: Voices of concern shouting from other apartments can be heard as Lionel turns back to help a shaking Laura onto the roof. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) It’s okay...we’re okay. But we gotta move. She nods and they start toward the ROOFTOP DOOR to a STAIRWELL...they are half way across when OUT OF THE SHADOW STEPS... LOU...cold and precise, he LIFTS A SILENCED REVOLVER. Lionel steps in front of Laura... Pink Revisions 139. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) Tell him she doesn’t know. I have what they want. Tell him...
C: LOU
E: laughs
D: That offer expired. And they said you were smart...
N: He pulls the hammer back and levels it... LIONEL: something behind Lou catching his eye... CLANG! LOU DROPS LIKE A LOG, revealing... THE TRUMPETER...WIELDING HIS HORN LIKE AN BASEBALL BAT...THE INSTRUMENT BADLY BENT from the impact with Lou’s head... The SAX PLAYER and BILLY’S FRIEND from the club step out behind him.
C: TRUMPETER
D: Motherfucker, smoked my best horn.

C: LIONEL
E: writes something down
D: I want to see him alone. Yeah, right now. Try anything funny and tomorrow will be the worst day you’ve had in a long time.
N: He hangs up...looks at Laura. She looks shell-shocked. He looks at THE TRUMPETER who nods at him. Under control. LIONEL takes THE FOLDED DOCUMENT that MINNA LEFT HIM WITH THE FILE out of his coat pocket...shows the TRUMPETER something on it. LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D) You know where this is? Can you take her there?

E: to Laura
D: Go with them. You’ll be safe at this place tonight.
C: LAURA
D: What don’t I know?
N: He stops and looks at her.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: It wasn’t the story she wanted to hear. And no good would come from telling it, so I wanted to say ‘It doesn’t matter. It’s got nothing to do with you.’ But there’s no upside in lying to a woman who’s smarter than you, so I told her the truth...
N: We see him telling her the dark truth and her head drops and we CUT TO: INT. PUBLIC ATHLETIC CLUB - POOL - NIGHT We’ve been here before...the HUGE PRIVATE POOL with its canopy of glass...but now more dimly lit inside and steamy
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: Frank told me once if you’re up against someone bigger than you, someone you can’t beat toe to toe: make em think you respect their size and cut a deal that lets you walk out in one piece. Then figure out a way to stick it to em later without leaving your prints on the knife. Even walking in there I wasn’t sure exactly how to play it. I just hoped in all the steam he wouldn’t see me sweating.
N: Lionel is admitted through a door He moves to a bench and sits to wait as A FIGURE SWIMS IN THE DARK, churning the water with powerful strokes. MOSES RANDOLPH: swimming powerfully from the far end toward him. He exits the pool, puts on a robe and stands over Lionel, IMPOSING and FIERCE. LIONEL is ticcing badly...not able to control his nerves. He YELPS TWICE...almost a BARK...then.. Pink Revisions 141.
C: LIONEL
D: Who’s the fucking Boss now, Bailey! Who’s the boss!
N: RANDOLPH regards him cooly...interested.
C: RANDOLPH
D: So what is it with you?
C: LIONEL
D: I got somethin’ wrong with my head. Didn’t your goons fill you in yet?
C: RANDOLPH
D: I don’t care about your fucking affliction. I mean what's your angle in this? What do you want for that file?
C: LIONEL
D: I want to hear your version of it.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Why?
C: LIONEL
D: Let’s just say an unfinished puzzle makes my head hurt, more’n most people.
N: Randolph turns this over...assessing it.
C: RANDOLPH
D: I smooth it all out for your pain in the ass brain...we putting this to bed tonight?
C: LIONEL
D: It’s you best shot.
N: Randolph SITS DOWN NEXT TO HIM RANDOLPH (cont’d) I was young. I was the Get Things Done man for the greatest governor in the history of this state. (remembering) We had a party, it was the good years, before the Crash. The Tammany parties were like nothing before or since. We had a whole fucking hotel. I saw her there, working. (MORE) Pink Revisions 142. RANDOLPH (cont’d) She was...I’d never felt...lust... like that. Like a fist in my crotch. You know 25 years later when I think of her it still makes my blood move. (beat) I followed her into a service hall, she knew I had. She looked back at me and then went into a supply room. (beat) I went in there and I took her against the spare towels.
C: LIONEL
D: You raped her?
C: RANDOLPH
E: beat
D: I moved on her that first time. But I treated her well...gave her things. I saw to it that the Party used that hotel a lot for a few years. She could have disappeared any time. Stopped working there. But she didn’t. She was shy but she knew how things worked and she was always grateful.
N: Pink Revisions 143.
C: RANDOLPH
E: CONT'D
E: turns to Lionel
D: Then buddy the Dodgers can take it on the arches to the fucking coast and I'll get a new team that plays ball with ME, in MY stadium. And if I want to fuck a colored girl in a hotel room now and then because I'm feeling like a wrecking ball then, pal, I'm gonna do it. And if you think I'm gonna let some little chip who never should have been born, or your small time boss or my brother and his ideals and his forgeries in my name slow down what I'm GETTING DONE in this city, you gotta lot to learn about how power works. Cause all those people are invisible...they don't even exist.
C: LIONEL
D: See if you feel that way tomorrow when they blow up your big vote.
C: RANDOLPH
D: She know?
N: Lionel’s look says no. Randolph calculates... RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D) Interesting. So it's you and Paul. I know what he wants. If he had any balls he'd have used this before to box me in and take it from me. I’d have respected that actually, but he thinks the way you do things matters. It's why he’ll never be anybody. You an idealist too? You gonna trade me that file to save the block you grew up on? Make me draw my lines somewhere else for some committee of childless women, howling about their negro adoptees? Or you just another blackmailing gumshoe who wants to transact with me? Name it!
C: LIONEL
E: beat - calms
D: Name it! CLAIM it! Shame it! That blackmailing gumshoe was my friend and that girl is the only reason you’re still breathing.
N: Pink Revisions 144.
C: LIONEL
E: CONT'D
D: Do what you want to the city. Build your pyramids on the Nile. But you leave her alone. Anything happens to her, it gets mailed.
N: Randolph narrows his eyes...reading into this, countering...
C: RANDOLPH
D: Make no mistake, you or Paul messes with what I intend to get done and I'll make her life even worse than I made his. You tell him I said that.
C: LIONEL
E: turns
D: I guess we’ve got a deal. So I’ll give you one for free. You man Lieberman is gonna cause you problems.
C: RANDOLPH
D: How so?
C: LIONEL
D: He owns a piece of half the companies doing contracts with slum clearance. And I’m guessing he hasn’t told you about that. So when you ‘handle’ him...tell him it was me that told you and that that’s for Frank.
C: RANDOLPH
E: actually surprised
D: Son of a bitch. You come off weird, but you’re smart. You should’ve taken my offer. You could’ve made em all get on their knees and apologize.
N: On that Lionel stands and turns to go. Randolph looks up RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D) Oh, and tell my brother... I read his masterwork. It’s as brilliant as everyone says. (MORE) Pink Revisions 145. RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D) Nobody else could have done it and it’s good for absolutely everyone, including me. There’s not one reason to deny it. Tell him I’ll send him my thoughts in the morning. Lionel nods, and walks away into the steam. Randolph looks down on the bench to see: Lionel has left MINNA’S HAT BEHIND. He stares off...
C: RANDOLPH
E: CONT’D
D: SON OF A BITCH!
N: The echoes and we CUT TO: EXT. DAWN ON THE CITY / LIONEL DRIVING - MONTAGE Images of the city interspersed with Lionel driving, getting somewhere beyond it all. Long Island. EXT. PAUL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING Paul can be seen in the entryway, pulling his mail out of the box with some urgency...expectant. He sifts it, his focus is on one envelope that has arrived. He comes out into the cold stares at the envelope a beat then looks up into the morning sun, takes a breath and opens it...reads the letter... CU: Personal stationary with ‘MR’ at the top and one large hand-written word: ‘DENIED.’ WIDE ON: Paul’s sad figure, shoulders sagging The letter falls out of his hand and blows away in the cold wind. As he turns and shambles away down the street, disappearing into shadow... We are back with LIONEL IN THE CAR, CROSSING BRIDGES, FAR OUT OF THE CITY NOW
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
E: MORE
D: Growing up, I always thought Frank was a hero but he was no crusader in the end. He was just a gumshoe trying to make a buck like everyone else. But he didn’t have to go to that war.
N: Pink Revisions 146.
C: LIONEL
E: V.O.
D: He was old enough to have skipped it and he went anyway because he actually thought this country was worth fighting for. I never had anything I cared about enough to look past my own problems. But Laura did. There was a story she wanted told and I figured it was time to get off my ass and pick a side.
N: INT. NY POST NEWSROOM - MORNING - CONTINUOUS JAKE GLEASON, the Reporter, sits at his desk with his feet up reviewing his notes. A NEWSBOY blows past the desk dropping an envelope on it
C: NEWSBOY
D: Gleason...for you
N: GLEASON sits forward and picks it up, eyes scanning AUDIO FLASHBACK: we hear Lionel and Gleason from when they first met...LIONEL: “Hey pal, what’s the story here?” GLEASON: “Stories of injustice and despair...the American Way.” And we see, CU: on the envelope is written “STORIES OF INJUSTICE AND DESPAIR” OR...A BETTER STORY FOR A REAL REPORTER. LET’S MAKE THINGS INTERESTING....A FRIEND” GLEASON’S brow furrows, remembering...curious. He opens the envelope and reacts at LIONEL HAS RETURNED HIS PRESS CARD, CLIPPED TO A NOTE “THANKS FOR THE LOAN. PAY YOU BACK WITH A PULITZER” Now GLEASON is really intrigued and, as the music rises, he looks at the document and we see that LIONEL HAS STOLEN THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE HALL OF RECORDS THAT SHOW THAT EXPOSE LIEBERMAN AND THE BA OFFICERS...LIEBERMAN’S NAME IS CIRCLED ON GLEASON’S FACE, as his jaw drops in shock. As what he’s got washes over him, a smile breaks across his face and he starts laughing with delight and we CUT TO: EXT. A BEACH HOUSE - MORNING Lionel’s car pulls up on the edge of a sand-swept road and he gets out and sees. Pink Revisions 147. LAURA sitting wrapped in blankets on the porch of a weathered little house. He stops at the bottom step and stands facing her.

D: What is this place?
C: LIONEL

D: Still looking out for you after all. Funny how things turn out.
N: He nods and stares outward at something...puzzling at a memory.

D: “Brooklyn’s big, but there’s things even bigger.”
C: LAURA
D: What’s that?
C: LIONEL
D: I think it’s something Frank said to me but I can’t remember when.
C: LAURA
D: Maybe this is what he meant.
N: AND WE CUT BEHIND THEM and see the enormous COLD, BLUE OCEAN, WAVES POUNDING ONTO MILES OF FROZEN EMPTY WHITE SAND.
C: LIONEL
D: If! IF!
N: Pink Revisions 148. She puts her hand gently on his back and he settles. She leans into him, he closes his eyes and sighs and, AS THEIR LONELY SONG SWELLS UP, we....CUT TO BLACK.
