LIONEL=>Frank always used to say: “Tell your story walking, pal...’
LIONEL CONT=>He was more philosophical than your average gumshoe, but he liked to do his talking on the move so... Here’s how it all went down.
LIONEL=>I got something wrong with my head, that’s the first thing to know
LIONEL=>IF!
LIONEL=>It’s like having glass in the brain. I can’t stop picking things apart, twisting em around, words and sounds especially. It’s like an itch that has to be scratched.
CONEY=>Quit pullin’ at it. You’re gonna make a fuckin’ mess outta things.
LIONEL=>I got threads in my heads! I got threads in my HEADS! I GOT THREADS IN MY HEADS, MAN!
LIONEL=>And I twitch a lot. It’s hard to miss. Makes me look like a goddam spastic but if I try to hold it back it just makes it worse.
CONEY=>Like I said, a fucking mess. Jesus, freakshow. Ruin another sweater.
LIONEL=>Fucking mess is right. The nuns said my soul wasn’t at peace with God and I should do penance. Frank said anyone teaching God’s love while they hit you with a stick should be ignored on every subject.
LIONEL=>Frank Minna. If you had to pick just one guy to be on your side, he’s the one you’d want. It’s Minna’s game. We’re all just in the lineup.
MINNA=>Boys.
CONEY=>Boss.
LIONEL=>Heya, Frank. FRANKLY FRANKADY FRANKO!
MINNA=>Okay listen...here’s the shot... I’ll be third floor. Lionel go to the payphone on the corner in 20 minutes. When they come.. probably three or four of em...when they come, you call me here... I’ll buzz em in. Coney waits on the door, I buzz him in and he stays right inside. Lionel’s listening sharp on the line. If you hear me say “Then we have a problem” hustle over, Coney lets you in, two of you come upstairs and back me up quick, okay?
CONEY=>What’s going down here, Frank?
MINNA=>I gotta keep this one under my hat, boys.
LIONEL=>Fat cats in HATS!
MINNA=>Them’s the ones, pal. Let’s catch a big score and get outta this game, get fat ourselves.
CONEY=>Boss, we’re not carrying.
MINNA=>What?
CONEY=>A piece. I don’t have a piece.
MINNA=>A piece? Say ‘gun’, Gilbert.
CONEY=>I got no gun.
MINNA=>That’s what I count on. That’s how I sleep at night, you with no gun. I’ve got a gun. You just show up. I wouldn’t want you chuckleheads coming up a stairway for me with a hairpin. With a harmonica.
LIONEL=>Hairy chin. Harmony harp. Don’t wind me up.
MINNA=>With an unlit cigar. With a fucking chicken wing. Right, Brooklyn?
LIONEL=>Chicky wing ding! Quit winding me up! You’ll throw me off. Just give us the rest of it.
MINNA=>Right. Now, if I say “Lemme use the can.” it means we’re coming out. Get Gil, get in the car and get ready to follow. And stay tight, I might need to give someone the slip, got it?
LIONEL=>‘Problem’- up the stairs, ‘use the can’- start the car. Got it. Get, gotten, got, GOTCHA!
MINNA=>Lionel’s got it. Just follow his lead.
CONEY=>You gotta be kidding me...
MINNA=>Coney what did I say when I came into the office last Tuesday?
CONEY=>Huh?
MINNA=>Lionel?
LIONEL=>Took your coat off, put your hat on the 3rd hook, said “I just stood next to a girl on the ferry and the smile she gave me will get me through this winter” Threw Danny your notebook. “How’s a guy supposed to keep a marriage together when 22 is on the menu?”
MINNA=>Like I said, Lionel’s on point.
LIONEL=>Sit on it, Bailey! IF!
LIONEL=>Fucking Bailey. Bailey is what my head calls me. It calls me out if I try to resist it. There’s things that calm it down: gum, weed, sometimes something stronger if I’m in bad shape. But if I try to put a lid on it it gets worse. If I get nervous it gets worse. If I get excited it gets worse. It’s the argument I can’t win.
CONEY=>Hey, watch it! Another Minna Classic. Freezin’ our asses off, don’t even know the score.
LIONEL=>What you got big plans this weekend, Coney? Coney Island! Coney Island hot dogs! Get your Coney Island hot dogs right here!!
CONEY=>Alright, Freakshow, just a little quieter please...
MINNA=>Yeah.
LIONEL=>Hey, boss. Boss, bossy, BITCH!
MINNA=>You keeping it together, Brooklyn?
LIONEL=>Yeah...it’s under control. I got my gum. I got ya covered.
MINNA=>I know it. Okay, like we said, stay tuned in, pal. I’m might need that head of yours later.
LIONEL=>Hey. I think your friends are here.
MINNA=>Cool as can be. Just a little chat.
LIONEL=>‘Here Lies Frank Minna. Cool as can be.’ They’ll carve that on his fucking tombstone. I don’t know if it was growing up in Greenpoint or fighting the Japanese, but he was cool under pressure in a way you can’t teach.
LIONEL=>I was just happy to have job on his team. And if there’s one thing my pain in the ass brain does know how to do...it’s listen and remember things.
LOU=>When I want a drink I’ll find a bar and a blonde, now explain this crap.
MINNA=>Well, which part didn’t you understand?
LOU=>How about the part where you got the idea to go poke around after some colored broad for starters.
LIONEL=>Cold wig on a rod !
MINNA=>She works for the committee.
LOU=>She’s a fucking secretary. We told you to dig on Horowitz...find something we can shut them down with.
MINNA=>There’s nothing there. Unless you’re dumb enough to try to wave that old Red flag of yours one more time. Yeah, right.
MINNA=>So, if you want to know what’s going in that report, that ‘colored broad’ is doing most of the legwork on Hamilton for ‘em. And what she’s sniffing around I’m sure is of concern to you gentlemen, so I put some time into that too.
LIEBERMAN=>You looked in some funny places.
MINNA=>What can I tell ya? I’m a snoop, that’s what I do. It’s called being thorough, Lou.
LOU=>It’s called wasting our time. This is fucking Chinese.
MINNA=>If you need a road map to wipe your ass I can’t help you, Lou. These gentlemen understand it or they wouldn’t be here.
LIEBERMAN=>Walk us through it, Mr. Minna, just to be sure we’re very clear.
MINNA=>It’s right here in ink, Mo---
LIEBERMAN=>None of this can be proved.
MINNA=>That signature is the real deal.
LIEBERMAN=>If you knew the man, you’d know why that seems highly implausible to me.
MINNA=>I checked it against others. It’s his John Hancock. And the paper trail backs it up. Lay that on top of the rest of what I’ve included here and I think we can all agree you’re sitting on a powder keg.
LIEBERMAN=>And you think Horowitz knows all of this?
MINNA=>Nope. Or you’d already be eating shit. It’ve been in the paper the next day.
LIEBERMAN=>The girl: she married, got family?
MINNA=>It’s all in my file...her mother’s dead. No brother or sisters.
LIEBERMAN=>What about her father?
MINNA=>Lou you’re Mr Straight Talk. Why don’t you go ask him and see what he says.
LOU=>You think this is funny?
MINNA=>No, Lou, just ironic. There’s a difference. Look it up. Father’s a busted up vet. He runs a jazz club up here. Drinks too much.
LIEBERMAN=>Mr Minna, I’ll assume you’re aware of what occurs a week from Thursday?
MINNA=>I am.
LIEBERMAN=>So then you understand our firm determination to keep such information out of the hands of our detractors?
MINNA=>Sure. Nature of the game.
LIEBERMAN=>These are all photos. May I hope you’re in possession of the originals?
MINNA=>I am.
LIEBERMAN=>Excellent. We’ll need to get those from you.
MINNA=>I figured as much. I thought we might talk about terms.
LIEBERMAN=>Terms?
MINNA=>I think it’s fair to say that the initiative involved in securing these...assets...goes a good bit beyond the original scope of work in our arrangement.
LOU=>...the fuck are you talkin’?
MINNA=>I’m thinking a bonus...for taking a wild card off the table before it got in the game.
LIEBERMAN=>I see. And what do you have in mind?
LOU=>Have you lost your mind?
MINNA=>Let’s not kid each other fellas. You got the biggest gravy train this century pulling out. I’m asking for a seat in the rear here.
LIEBERMAN=>That’s quite impossible.
MINNA=>I’d double this at any paper in town.
LOU=>I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say what you just said and we’re gonna-
MINNA=>Just an observation. I’m here in good faith. Just assessing the value...
LOU=>You can forget it--
MINNA=>Jeez Lou, what’s your beef with a guy getting paid for good work? I mean you get paid for doing nothing as far as I can--- UHHNH!
DEEP VOICE=>Watch it.
LOU=>Are you fuckin’ packin’!?
MINNA=>Jesus, take it easy...Had it since the war. Remember that thing some of us fought in?
LIEBERMAN=>Enough! Lou...a word...
MINNA=>Oh come on fellas, don’t get in a twist, it’s just busi...
LIEBERMAN=>Mr. Minna, we do appreciate the service you’ve rendered. These gentlemen will take you to get the originals and if all is in order we’ll arrange an appropriate resolution for you.
MINNA=>Sure, of course...like I said, good faith. Just lemme use the can first...
LIONEL=>PURPLE HITTER!!
CONEY=>What?
LIONEL=>They hit him! It sounded like they hit him!
CONEY=>For chrissake, freakshow! What are we doing here?
LIONEL=>No. He said “lemme use the can” We’re supposed to follow him. CAN THE MAN!
CONEY=>I don’t like it...
LIONEL=>Me neither, let’s go.
CONEY=>This fucking guy!
LIONEL=>EAT ME MISTER DICKEY-WEED!
LIONEL=>LEFT! LEFT! Lefty Louie Lick Me!
LIONEL=>Slow down...slow down.
LIONEL=>We lost him!
CONEY=>Where’s he going?
LIONEL=>The ramp... he’s going to Queens. QueenieConeyQueenieConeyQueenie!
LIONEL=>Son of a bitch!
CONEY=>What?!
LIONEL=>We need a quarter! Get a fuckin’ quarter out!
LIONEL=>Don’t lose em! Jesus, Coney, come on!
CONEY=>What can I do?! Guy had a fucking pass!
LIONEL=>HORNY HORN! HONK ME, BAILEY!
LIONEL=>There, go left! LEFTY LOOSY LIONEL!
CONEY=>They gotta be somewhere.
LIONEL=>I’d say they’re somewhere, Gil, yes! Where?
LIONEL=>GO BACK!!
LOU=>C’MON!!
LIONEL=>FRANK!
MINNA=>Wanna help me outta here please?
CONEY=>Oh, shit...
LIONEL=>Help me.
MINNA=>AAH! Jesus Coney, you lug wrench!
CONEY=>Frank, forget--
MINNA=>JUST GET MY HAT YOU BIG OAF!! Get my gun too!
LIONEL=>Head for the hospital. Hospitable HERPETOLOGIST!
CONEY=>I don’t know around here!
MINNA=>Mercy Hospital! Straight up McGuinness, you cabbageheads!
CONEY=>Fuck happened, Frank?
MINNA=>Took em on a goose chase and tried to slip em...
LIONEL=>We shoulda jumped in sooner, I thought you were signaling...
MINNA=>Nah, not your fault...almost made it. Forgot they had my gun.
MINNA=>Rookie move. Got through Guadalcanal without a scratch and I get shot with my own gun in Queens.
CONEY=>You gonna be okay?
MINNA=>Yeah, yeah. Clipped me in the side. Gotta get a new belt but they didn’t hit nothing important.
LIONEL=>Who? Who were they?
MINNA=>Don’t worry about it. Talk to me, Brooklyn. I need a joke. You got one you been saving?
LIONEL=>Huh? Okay. Guy walks into a bar...
MINNA=>Bar joke. All the best ones, right?
LIONEL=>Guy walks into a bar with an octopus. Says to the bartender “I’ll bet a hundred this octopus can play any instrument in the joint.”
MINNA=>Funny already. An octopus. Already in the black here.
LIONEL=>REACTOPUS! Bartender points to a piano. Guy puts the octopus up on the stool-- PIANOPUS! Octopus plays a few scales and then lays out a little etude...
MINNA=>Getting fancy, huh? Showin’ off a little?
LIONEL=>EAT ME BAILEY! Bartender pulls out a guitar. Octopus tunes the E string, closes its eyes and whips out a sweet little fandango--
MINNA=>He’s milking it.
LIONEL=>FANDAFAG!-- Guys says, “Pay up.” Bartender say, “Hang on.” Rummages around and finds an old set of bagpipes. Plops em on the bar. Guy brings the octopus over-- OCTAPIPES! FUUU---
MINNA=>Don’t blow the punch, Lionel.
LIONEL=>Octopus looks em over. Squints at em, takes another look. Bartender says, “Pay up! He can’t play it!” And the Octopus says, “Play it? If I can figure out how to get its pajamas off I’m gonna fuck it!” FUCK ME IN TRUCK, BAILEY!
MINNA=>Jesus, what are we doing?
CONEY=>Almost there...
LIONEL=>Hang on, Boss. Tell us who did it.
MINNA=>Shouldn’ta messed with em. Stupid.
CONEY=>They plugged you and left you in the goddam garbage, Frank! Now who was it?
MINNA=>I’ll tell ya later. Just drive, meatloaf!
LIONEL=>MEAT MONGER! LOAF-A-LOPE!
MINNA=>A whole fuckin’ herd of em.
ORDERLY=>Get this car out of here!
CONEY=>We’re an ambulance today, pal.
MINNA=>No...
NURSE=>Sir...
LIONEL=>Boss, who was in that room?
MINNA=>Ah shit, Brooklyn, she’s in trouble now.
LIONEL=>Who, Frank? What went down in there?!
MINNA=>Played outta my league...shoulda kept it...
LIONEL=>Blood Bag, Bailey!
NURSE=>Sir, you can’t be in here!
MINNA=>Hey, Brooklyn...
LIONEL=>I’m here, Frank.
MINNA=>You’re no freak. Okay?
LIONEL=>Okay. Who did it, Frank?
MINNA=>Formosa...
LIONEL=>Formosa? What is that?
MINNA=>For..mos..
DOCTOR=>Move!
NURSE=>Sir!!
LIONEL=>Guy walks into a bar...
DOCTOR=>Are you his friend?
LIONEL=>Guy walks into a bar...
DOCTOR=>He didn’t make it.
LIONEL=>Oh no... A guy walks--
DOCTOR=>--I’m very sorry--
LIONEL=>--into a bar! SO SORRY, BAILEY!
TONY=>...the fuck you let him get in that car for, Freakshow?
LIONEL=>He gave us the cue to follow. We made a move to get in...but he signaled me off...I think...
TONY=>You think? You said they roughed him up in the room though.
LIONEL=>I’m not sure. They mighta. Anyway he said “use the can” after that. Can the loose man.
TONY=>So he’s takin’ em to something they want and they off him? It doesn’t track.
LIONEL=>I told you he tried to give em the slip...I don’t know, it happened fast and we didn’t see it.
TONY=>How the fuck’d you drop so far off him?
LIONEL=>I told you three times, Tony... We lost him at the bridge, they had some fucking badge! The fuck were we supposed to do?!
CONEY=>Freakshow’s right. It was a mess.
DANNY=>So who were they?
CONEY=>He wouldn’t say. Even in the car after.
TONY=>Right. That’s great, Frank.
DANNY=>We gotta tell Julia.
TONY=>I told her already.
DANNY=>When?
TONY=>She called looking for Frank.
LIONEL=>Timbuktuk-it. How’d she take it?
TONY=>How’d you think she took it, Freak- -
LIONEL=>Don’t say it again, I ain’t in the mood!
TONY=>Alright take it easy...I’m just saying...you know how she can be.
DANNY=>Someone should take her his things.
LIONEL=>I’ll do it.
DANNY=>Go on, take it. You can’t go walk around like that. You sure you wanna do this?
LIONEL=>I was with him. Maybe she’ll want to know what happened at the end.
TONY=>He say anything about her?
LIONEL=>No.
TONY=>Then help him out one last time and lie a little.
JULIA=>Oh...Lionel.
LIONEL=>Hi Julia...
JULIA=>Don’t bother. The hospital already called.
LIONEL=>No...I brought you Frank’s things.
JULIA=>Oh. I thought you were gonna break the news to me again.
LIONEL=>Julia, I’m really...
JULIA=>Yeah, nice twist huh? Didn’t see that one coming, I gotta say.
LIONEL=>Twisty twinky. Sorry.
JULIA=>Look, I just wanna be alone, okay?
LIONEL=>Sure.
JULIA=>Gimme the watch I guess. I don’t want all the rest of that stuff.
LIONEL=>I’m gonna keep his gun, if that’s okay with you. You want his hat?
JULIA=>What for? Is there money in that wallet?
LIONEL=>I was.
JULIA=>That’s good. He really liked you, you know?
LIONEL=>Yeah. He was talking about you...wanted me to tell you he...
JULIA=>Yeah, don’t bullshit me. Goddam it, I’m pissed at him!
LIONEL=>Don’t be.
JULIA=>Well I am!
LIONEL=>Julia...Frank say anything to you about what he was working on?
JULIA=>He never told me what he was mixed up in. You got no idea who did it?
LIONEL=>But if I figure it out, I’m gonna make ‘em regret it. I promise you that.
JULIA=>Don’t promise me. It makes no difference to me one way or the other.
MAN=>Let em in, Charlie.
VOICE=>...limited only by our own vision, our own audacity, we will build the legacy of our time. A legacy for future generations to look upon and say “Here was Boldness. Here is the greatest of what Man can create.”
MAYOR=>Ah, Mo...splendid!
THE MAN=>I do.
MAYOR=>Do you solemnly swear to serve the people of New York and uphold the integrity of the office of Commissioner of Building and Construction?
THE MAN=>I do.
MAYOR=>Good to have you aboard, Mo. Keep up the good work.
WOMAN REFORMER=>I’ll be damned, he did it.
REFORMER #2=>I told you. He’s no pushover this one.
WOMAN REFORMER=>$10 it won’t last past noon.
THE MAN=>What is this shit? What about City Planning?!
MAYOR=>Sorry, what’s all this now, Mo?
THE MAN=>Don’t play games with me, you mutt! I get City Planning or I quit the other two. Right now. The reporters are still here.
MAYOR=>Easy now, it’s nothing to get hot about. Probably just an oversight. They didn’t give me the blank. Give us a day to get settled in and I’ll see to it.
THE MAN=>NOW SIGN IT!
RANDOLPH=>Right! Bunch of fucking amateurs.
MAYOR=>Close that damn door and keep it closed!
NEWS ANNOUNCER=>...new life in talks between the City and Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley who wants a site and financing for a new stadium to keep the boys in Brooklyn...
PAPERBOY=>Dodgers can stay if City will give em a Yard!
JULIA=>...asking all kinds a questions...I told em “Christ he’s dead, what are you gonna arrest him?”
CONEY=>..the fuck you been? Called you all morning.
LIONEL=>What the hell happened?
CONEY=>Danny had a early run out to Belmont. Came in and found it like this.
DANNY=>Cops were at Frank’s place too... going through everything.
JULIA=>...assholes. Picking in my underwear drawer and grinning at me.
TONY=>We’re gonna find out who did this and get to the bottom of it, right boys?
JULIA=>I don’t even wanna know. Always with his cryptic shit, telling me he was into something big this time...gonna change our situation. Gets himself whacked and leaves me $4000 in a savings and loan, a drafty shack in Lookout Point and this...thriving operation. Ace moves, Frank...
TONY=>Sure, doll. It’s the right thing.
CONEY AND DANNY=>‘Course. Sure.
TONY=>You want me to take you home?
JULIA=>No thanks. I’m gonna go stay with my sister for a while...think about my future. But call me...you know.. with an update?
LIONEL=>Sorry...
CONEY=>Jesus, Freakshow.
LIONEL=>Touch it, Bailey!
DANNY=>Assholes even pulled the tank off the john.
TONY=>Alright, forget that, do it later. Right now, just the four of us: Does anybody know what Frank was into on this?
CONEY=>He just told us to meet him for a sit. He didn’t even make like it was a big thing.
LIONEL=>He was nervous though.
TONY=>Nervous how?
CONEY=>He wasn’t nervous.
LIONEL=>Were you on that line, dumbshit? I’m telling you he was nervous. Nervous Nellie! I could hear it. He was making some kind of a play. There’s something big going down a week from Thursday and whatever he found they weren’t happy about it.
CONEY=>Obviously. They whacked him for it.
LIONEL=>CRACK WACKER! I don’t think they meant to...I think when they shot him the they messed up and now they’re stuck looking for whatever he found.
TONY=>Some fuckin’ riddle. Jesus H. I’m gonna say this: I loved the guy. When we were in that fucking hell hole he saw something in us and threw us a line...taught us how to operate. But he never cut us in all the way. He played his own games and I’m not gonna stick my nose around his dead cards and risk ending up on a slab for it.
LIONEL=>You owe him more’n that, T.
TONY=>Yeah? Well you figure out what the fuck it was all about, let us know. Meantime, I’m finishing up on the rabbi’s wife. She’s banging a butcher who ain’t kosher so I think he’s really gonna give her the boot this time and that’s gonna be the last of that ride.
TONY=>I want Gil sitting on the Gunderson fraud thing...
LIONEL=>I’m on Gunderson.
TONY=>I want Gil on it...When we bust him the insurance company might want us in there to show the pictures to his lawyer and I wanna make a good impression and Frank ain’t here to cover for you.
LIONEL=>Fraud fag!
TONY=>Like I said. Gil, you’re on it. Danny’ll back me on nights and Lionel you pick up the car slack for him until something else comes in.
LIONEL=>Tony and Coney and Danny and me. Before we were Minna’s men we were all just dead end kids at the Catholic orphanage.
LIONEL=>Invest-ahead.
LIONEL=>I was worse in there. Total freakshow. Nobody knew what to do with me. The nuns thought they could beat it out of me. One in particular. Until Tony grabbed the paddle out of her hand and told her if she hit me again he’d give it to her twice as hard. Coney and Danny were standing behind him and she knew they weren’t bluffing. After that, I was in their crew.
VOICE=>Tony Vermonte in?
LIONEL=>He’s out on a case, how can I help you?
VOICE=>Who am I speaking to?
LIONEL=>ASSROG! Lionel Essrog, associate invest--
LIONEL=>FORM MY ASS, BAILEY!
LIONEL=>Frank was just from the neighborhood. He was smart. Everybody knew he was going places. Everybody liked him. He was friends with one of the priests and heard I had a thing for remembering numbers and words. He had uses for that. He was the one who taught me how to use my head, get it under control, make it work for me. He took all us is under his wing eventually. Gave us a place in this shitty world.
DANNY=>Lionel?
LIONEL=>IF!
DANNY=>Jesus Christ...through the glass. Thought I was seeing a ghost. What are you doing?
LIONEL=>Spinning. You back already?
DANNY=>Nah, a round trip. Gotta go back in a bit.
LIONEL=>I shoulda never let him get in that car. I think I blew it, Danny.
DANNY=>I had a Sergeant during the Bulge...He told me “Sometimes you do everything you’re supposed to and it still goes to shit.” It ain’t on you, bud.
LIONEL=>Yeah. Thanks, D.
DANNY=>Any calls?
LIONEL=>What? Oh yeah...shit. What time is it? Gotta pickup at 2:30.
DANNY=>What like the Jap island?
DANNY=>Nope. He was wounded and out before that.
LIONEL=>Frank didn’t have to cover for me, he just never put me out into situations that were going to punch my buttons. Talking to people, getting information out of em, that’s the bread and butter of the trade but never my strong suit...
LIONEL=>...especially if a girl shows up in the mix. And in this line of work, they usually do.
BARTENDER=>Music’s at seven.
LIONEL=>Can I get an early one? Whiskey ginger.
BARTENDER=>Most of my life.
LIONEL=>You know a guy named Minna? Frank. That’s him.
BARTENDER=>Everybody looks like everybody to me. But I don’t think so. She’s good with faces.
HOSTESS=>Nice face.
LIONEL=>Nice yourself.
HOSTESS=>Got a light?
HOSTESS=>Ooh. You a tease?
LIONEL=>Sorry...
HOSTESS=>Jeez, forget I asked.
BARTENDER=>You got something against blondes?
LIONEL=>Nah, it’s...it has to sound right or I can’t stop doing it.
BARTENDER=>Must be inconvenient.
LIONEL=>Buddy, you don’t know the half of it.
BARTENDER=>That uptown shit’s the real deal, huh? You get up there much?
LIONEL=>I don’t know it.
BARTENDER=>Jazz joint in Harlem. Lucky’s is a good time too but the all the guys playing Hard are at the Rooster.
BARTENDER=>We ain’t open yet.
LIONEL=>Can I get an early one? I’m freezing here. Whiskey neat.
BARTENDER=>I look like the manager?
LIONEL=>Who’s playing tonight?
BARTENDER=>Hey, Billy...
BILLY=>Mr Big Shot.
BARTENDER=>I hope they don’t think they drinking free.
BARTENDER=>You caught this cat? I seen cool. This brother rewriting cool.
BARTENDER=>Don’t wait long. Them French girls keep loving him up he’s gonna move over there for good, you know what I’m saying?
LIONEL=>French Kissing Cats! Thanks pal.
LIONEL=>On my average day the weed will handle my twitching and shouting but it makes my thinking fuzzy.
LIONEL=>In my dreams I’m calm and clear like I was when I was a kid. Even after my head started messing with me, my mother could settle it down. She’d sing soft songs and stroke the back of my neck and it would leave me for a while. We’d lie on the bed and talk about all of the places we were gonna go.
SAVE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS!=>SAVE FT. GREENE! COME TO A PUBLIC HEARING ON PROPOSED HAMILTON HOUSING PLAN Sponsored by: Committee against Racial Discrimination in Housing
TONY=>Well, Christ, Coney, did you get the shot or not?...doing what?...Getting the paper ain’t worth shit! The fuck does that have to do with his back?... Bending over, my ass, we gotta have him lifting the lawnmower out the car or playing tennis or spinning around the room with some broad sittin’ up on his tentpole and his arms out wide. I don’t care so long as it involves his back!...I know he’s fakin’ all the time, that’s why he’s won three claims! Wait him out or set him up!... I know it’s cold, that’s why they call it winter!
DANNY=>If the guy lifted a cow into a truck, Coney’d still miss the shot. He still can’t remember to wind the film. Thinks it’s a Tommy- gun. I tell him ‘click-advance- click-advance”...
TONY=>Can it. I’m giving it a week.
LIONEL=>We got pickups?
DANNY=>Nobody ever needs a ride on Tuesday, you notice that? Never. Why is that?
TONY=>...speaking... Yeah fine...
DANNY=>Job?
TONY=>Nah. For me.
DANNY=>Don’t go getting mysterious on us, T. You ain’t no Minna.
TONY=>Yet! I gotta get a prescription for my mother, clambrain. You need all the details? I’m going for coffee, you want?
DANNY=>Cream and sugar.
LIONEL=>Hey, D... You up for something?
DANNY=>Like what?
LIONEL=>Sit on a joint for me.
DANNY=>For you?
LIONEL=>Club up in Harlem. I think Frank was there that day or the day before...it was in his pants, almost full. Fullsie Pants!
DANNY=>Maybe he stopped in for a book of matches.
LIONEL=>In the room he was talking about a girl, a colored chick. Something she knew had em pretty unhappy, wondering who else knew. Frank said her father is a busted up vet who runs a club...this joint is three blocks from that meet.
DANNY=>You went there?
LIONEL=>Manager is a guy named Billy with a bum arm.
DANNY=>So what am I supposed to do?
LIONEL=>Get in there see if you can get her name out of him. Do your liquor board bit. Lick Broader!
DANNY=>Yeah, that’s what she said. That’s it, get her name?
LIONEL=>Well if you got nothing better to do... sit on it a while, see if she shows.
DANNY=>If a colored chick shows up to a jazz joint? Lemme make a prediction...
LIONEL=>No, I’m working another angle. We’ll pin her down.
DANNY=>Okay but tell me something... What are we doing this for?
LIONEL=>Cause he’d a done it for us.
DANNY=>Right. It’s fuckin’ cold for a sit.
LIONEL=>Take the Bel Air, heater’ll roast you like a brisket. Bet on the bris!
DANNY=>You’re a rabbi too now, huh?
LIONEL=>You don’t want me handling your bris, believe me.
LIONEL=>If!
RECEPTIONIST=>Bless you.
LIONEL=>Thank you.
RECEPTIONIST=>Can I help you?
LIONEL=>Yes, I’m here to see Mildred?
RECEPTIONIST=>Mildred? There’s nobody by that name here.
LIONEL=>I think it was Mildred...
RECEPTIONIST=>Myrna...?
LIONEL=>My myna bird, Myrna!. No I believe she was a colored girl.
RECEPTIONIST=>Josephine or Laura?
LIONEL=>No I’m sure it was Mildred. She spoke to me on the phone about my application. What’s your name?
RECEPTIONIST=>Betty. What sort of application.
LIONEL=>My vendor’s license.
RECEPTIONIST=>It’s the Committee on Racial Discrimination in Housing.
LIONEL=>Then you can’t very well help me sell hot dogs can you! I’m sorry to have bothered you.
RECEPTIONIST=>You mean Mrs. Horowitz?
LIONEL=>Either one’ll do.
RECEPTIONIST=>She’s in the back...oh there she is...
LIONEL=>Horse-a-whip, Whore-a-witch, Horowitz.
TONY=>Holy shit, what happened?!
CONEY=>Who was it, D?
DANNY=>Couple of em. One was a giant.
TONY=>A what?
DANNY=>A fuckin’ giant, I’m telling you. Biggest guy I ever saw.
LIONEL=>They say anything?
DANNY=>Yeah, “Stay outta Minna’s garbage. Tell your crew the same.” Had a big nasty knife on my throat for that part.
CONEY=>Son of a...
DANNY=>Didn’t get this though...assholes.
TONY=>...the fuck is that? What are you two into?
DANNY=>Forget all that, she didn’t show up until later...tail end of the roll.
LIONEL=>Match me, Bailey! That’s it. She’s the one. Her name was Laura.
DANNY=>Laura Rose then maybe. That’s Billy Rose. If he’s her father...
CONEY=>How the hell you know that?
LIONEL=>You tailed her?
DANNY=>Didn’t have to...she lives right next to the club on the corner. They musta made me earlier. Soon as I got out the car to follow her they were on me...
LIONEL=>I’m telling you this is the colored broad Frank was tailing.
TONY=>Okay, I’m with you but it’s still pretty thin.
CONEY=>Skeletal.
LIONEL=>We only just started!
TONY=>Whatever they want so bad’s gotta be worth something, right? I’ll tell you what, Freakshow, me and Gil’ll stay on the money work, keep us floating...you and Danny keep sniffing it and we’ll see where we get.
LIONEL=>I ain’t looking to make a deal with these fucks but yeah, okay.
CONEY=>Whatever. Hell yeah, I hope those mugs poke around again. I’ll have something for em.
TONY=>Whaddya say, D?
DANNY=>Fellas, I loved the guy but...I mean I’ll handle the cars, hustle some domestic shit, you know, but I got Linda and...
LIONEL=>Sure, Danny. Right thing.
TONY=>No doubt. Get on home, get a steak on that eye.
CONEY=>C’mon, I’ll give you a lift.
TONY=>Look all I’m saying...maybe we can get something outta it, for Julia maybe...
LIONEL=>For Julia? She can go twist.
TONY=>Okay whatever. But don’t go holding out on shit with me though. We work together, okay Lionel? I’ll take anything we can scratch up to Mr. Capodanno and see what those boys know. We pin it on someone, we’ll square accounts. My word on it.
LIONEL=>Nah, I’m going home. I’ll see ya later.
TONY=>C’mon...let’s get a beer.
TONY=>Okay but don’t stay up too late, Kemosabe.
LIONEL=>Laura Rose. Rose is a rose is a rose... Larosa!
LIONEL=>Get out and pop your hood and check the oil.
CABBIE=>Buddy, come on...
LIONEL=>Keep the meter going.
LIONEL=>This ain’t my beat. What’s the story?
REPORTER=>Stories of injustice and despair, nodding heads and assurances, back to business as usual. The American Way. Although this one could make it interesting.
LIEBERMAN=>We’ll commence this public comment. State your name, address and affiliation please. I’m William Lieberman, Mayor’s Commission on Slum Clearance, resident of E.65th St, Manhattan
LADY AT MICROPHONE=>Cindy Fleming, homemaker, Yonkers...but formerly East Tremont. My family was forced to move when they seized our building for the Bronx Expressway, and I want people to know that--
LIEBERMAN=>Mrs. Horowitz, you may not hijack these proceedings to air out old complaints against...
GABBY=>Gabby Horowitz-Committee on Racial Discrimination in Housing- 552 Clinton Ave, BROOKLYN. I thought this was a community hearing?
LIEBERMAN=>On housing not highways...
GABBY=>You’re making the same promises to Ft Greene that you made in Tremont, where your so-called ‘relocation services’ vanished into thin air and left families like the Flemings utterly adrift. People have a right to know what they’re in for!
LIEBERMAN=>We are totally committed to the welfare of families displaced by necessary community improvement programs. The past has been instructive and our new contractors will ensure ALL find adequate homes...
GABBY=>This isn’t Long Island you know... It’s not just a blank canvas you can paint on anywhere you like. There are people here, established communities.
MAYOR=>I hope you all know my name. I’m the Mayor, newly residing at Gracie Mansion, Manhattan. Mrs Horowitz, thank you for work and your passion. Surely we can all agree that even in a City as great as ours we have slums. And that a slum is not something to romanticize or preserve. You tear it down and improve quality of--
GABBY=>A neighborhood is not a slum because poor people and minorities live there, Mr. Mayor. East Tremont wasn’t a slum, Third Avenue wasn’t a slum and Fort Greene is not a slum either, these are working class communities. Your developers are making it a slum!
RANDOLPH=>That is unsubstantiated, unmitigated bunk!
GABBY=>We have it on paper, we have twenty people here tonight and scores behind them who can testify to a scandalous fraud under way...which way would you like it first?
RANDOLPH=>We are embarking on the most ambitious slum clearance program in American history Mrs. Horowitz and you are gumming it up with your molasses! A Niagara of molasses!
VOICE=>MAKE HIM SAY HIS NAME!
MAN=>Name and place of residence, like everyone else!
MAYOR=>Now see here, we all know perfectly well who this is... Mo Randolph is one our greatest public servants. He’s a living legend.
MAN=>Name and residence like everybody else!
LIONEL=>Every Chevy shelf!
MAYOR=>He’s led the Parks Department for over 30 years...he’s Commissioner of Construction, well, he’s got too many jobs to name!
MAN=>Make him say it!!
MAYOR=>See here now, if we can’t keep this civil we’ll have to ask you to...
MAN=>SAY IT!
LIONEL=>Two fucking pigs in a blanket!
PAUL=>‘Hammy Ham House Head’, huh? That’s good. I’ll have to remember that one.
LIONEL=>IF! Sorry... IF!
PAUL=>Yeah, that’s the rub in life alright... ‘if’... ‘if only’...
LIONEL=>Hey, hold on... tell me something. That guy Lieberman, he’s in charge of this Hamilton deal?
PAUL=>In charge? No, he’s not in charge...More in charge than that guy calling himself Mayor but... They all work formosa...
LIONEL=>You said “Formosa”...what’s that?
PAUL=>What? Let me go! You nuts?!
LIONEL=>You said “They’re all working Formosa.” What’s that mean?
PAUL=>What’s ‘Formosa’? Let go of me. “For Moses.” Jesus. I said they’re working for Moses. Moses Randolph.
LIONEL=>Mo Randolph? That guy who came in?
PAUL=>Yeah...‘He who will not speak his name like one of the rabble’. What do you care?
LIONEL=>Jacob Gleason, the Post. Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
PAUL=>I’m hungry. You can buy me dinner.
PAUL=>The Mayor?! That clown is so green he doesn’t even know what he doesn’t know yet. He’ll be out the door before he even realizes that every person he turns to for advice is on Randolph’s payroll.
LIONEL=>I thought he was Commissioner of Parks?
PAUL=>He is.
LIONEL=>But they called him Construction Commissioner.
PAUL=>He’s that too now. They never even had that position until the Feds decided to get in the housing game. It had no defined powers so he defined ‘em and the Feds approved and now how much control of that money has the City got? Zero. He's got it all. You know what 'eminent domain' means? If he says it's a slum, it goes. He used to have to fight to put his highways and parks where he wanted, now he can go anywhere, tear anything down. He can condemn a whole section of the city, evict everyone who lives there and put up what he wants. And he'll go at it with an axe.
LIONEL=>SMACKS AXE. He’ll piss too many people off. He’ll be the most hated man in NY.
PAUL=>No, they love him! That’s what makes me so... He flies above it. They revere him.
LIONEL=>Why?
PAUL=>Because he built the parks! As long as you're the guy who brings people parks, you walk with the angels, you can't lose. The day Rockaway Beach opened, Moses Randolph became a folk hero in this town. But people don't realize how much he hates them. “The Hero of the Public Who Hates People”. There's your headline. And you know who he hates especially? He's going to seize every neighborhood in this city that's not white and turn it over to his hand-picked private Developers.
LIONEL=>So he’s getting rich. Paid off.
PAUL=>Nah, he doesn't want money...he wants control and he brokers money to get it and guard it. Some men aren't satisfied unless they have filet mignon. Moses would be happy with a pastrami sandwich and power. Can I get a piece of cheesecake? And warm it up. Yeah, I want it warm!
LIONEL=>But you said they just created the position...so how...?
PAUL=>Oh, christ...Construction-Parks- Slums...he’s got 14 appointments! That’s all just ink on a glass door, none of it matters, it’s all the BA.
LIONEL=>BA?
PAUL=>The Borough Authority, jeezus. Where do you come from, Iowa? Call yourself a reporter...on what, the Arts beat? You read Emerson?
LIONEL=>Should I?
PAUL=>Yes, you fucking should! Emerson said “an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man”...
PAUL=>This town is run by the Borough Authority and the Borough Authority is Moses Randolph.
LIONEL=>Lieberman. Leering man.
LIONEL=>That quack in the diner with pork chop and peas in his beard was one of the most talented engineers of his generation. Ivy League. Big awards. Walking right next to his brother toward being someone important. Then sometime right after the Crash, just nothing. Like he got erased.
LIONEL=>Maybe bad luck. Maybe booze. There was all kinds of casualties in those days.
LIONEL=>Gotta get this to Bill Lieberman.
SPEAKER=>Ladies and gentlemen, settle please and give me your serious attention. Our celebration is made special by tonight’s Guest of Honor...
SPEAKER=>...A Brother to our Trade who would rightly be hailed this country’s Master Builder. Or...the ‘Great Dirt Mover’, as he likes to be called!
LIONEL=>Gleason, right?
GLEASON=>Don’t let em see you take out a notebook. Tonight is: ‘Press: fuggedaboudit’.
SPEAKER=>We’d have to look to the Caesars and Pharaohs to find men with a scale of vision to compare with his and yet none of it bears his name, so fully does he forbear the credit, allowing the people to say “we built this ourselves.” A great man, a man of history, serving the people of this City for over 25 years...Moses Randolph!
LIONEL=>You’d think Patton showed up.
GLEASON=>He pays one and half times union rate as base on all his jobs. They’d pave over their mothers for him.
RANDOLPH=>Tonight, over 300 years since the founding of this great city, we recommit ourselves to the ancient truth...that it is not knowledge but Action...Enterprise...which is the engine and objective of life. Clever men come and go but for every dozen men with a bright idea there is at most one who can execute them.
RANDOLPH=>I look around this room and I don’t see a lot of Bright Boys or Goodie Goodie progressives with their paralyzing ideals! I see men of my tribe. Men who know how to Get Things Done! The Doers who make this country great. And an honor by you is all the affirmation or payment I’ll ever seek. I thank you and celebrate you.
RANDOLPH=>You finished it.
PAUL=>Best work I’ve ever done. A total modernization of the state’s electrical grid. And it’s a scale only you can get done.
RANDOLPH=>Clean yourself up for Chrissake...
PAUL=>With what!?
RANDOLPH=>Not fucking word out of you about any of that! Bring that up to me ever again I’ll close you out...
PAUL=>Close me out?! I’m so far out I’m doing piece work for kids fresh out of school!
RANDOLPH=>Whip up a crowd against me like that ever again and I’ll take your big idea and throw it on the scrap heap! That what you want?
PAUL=>No! NO!! Alright, I’m sorry. None of that matters. Just...read it please.
RANDOLPH=>I’ll read it.
LIONEL=>What makes a person go against their own brother? All my life I never had family so I never could understand people who did and let it get ugly.
LIONEL=>My crazy brain was telling me to pull on that thread, but whatever Frank found, he found it following the girl. So I just kept chasing his footsteps.
LIONEL=>Keep it together, freakshow.
ANGRY GUY=>Looking for somethin’?
LIONEL=>Scared the hell...HELP, BAILEY!
ANGRY GUY=>You think you can just walk into people’s homes?
LIONEL=>Looking for a friend. Didn’t look like anyone lived down here...
ANGRY GUY=>Oh, someone live here. My momma live here. Least she tryin’ to. Who you with? I hope you with Belmont.
LIONEL=>Yeah...course. Belmont. Who else, right?
LAURA=>How hard did you hit him?
ANGRY GUY=>I barely tapped him. Fool slipped and hit his own head!
LIONEL=>IF!!
LAURA=>‘If’ what? I’ll tell you what ‘if’, you better explain who you are if you want to walk out of-- Have I seen you before?
LIONEL=>My name’s Jake Gleason. I’m a reporter. I saw you at the Hamilton housing hearing. I called the committee. Came out here looking for you.
ANGRY GUY=>He the one said he’s with them racketeering sons a bitches! They stole her damn fridge and her copper pipe! What you expect?!
LAURA=>First they put up a notice says the house will be condemned. It’s not true but that scares out about half and they sell for cheap. Then they come in and take the nice old family homes and chop em into 4 and rent em up. Folks who don’t leave they harass... turn the heat off, come in to do repairs and steal copper pipe instead. They re-possessed all the refrigerators, even if people bought them themselves, then resold them out of shopfronts next neighborhood over. City sold em property worth $15 million for $500,000 to take the ‘risk’ of having to build the Federal projects. They haven’t even submitted plans...just milked it until it really is a slum.
LIONEL=>Slammer for Slum Lords, Bailey!
LAURA=>Oh what, you another one that thinks we’re just ‘agitating’... making it up like some Negro propaganda conspiracy...
LIONEL=>No, no. Look I got a condition, I say funny things sometimes but I’m not trying to be funny, okay? I’m listening. Where’s everybody go?
LAURA=>Mostly just disappear. Fade away. Go into real slums or other neighborhoods. Some are renting a room in a house they used to own. 200,000 in 2 years just from this part of Brooklyn. Mostly Negro. Latino.
LIONEL=>But Horowitz said they did it in Tremont too.
LAURA=>Yeah they did it to a few Jews too but not systematic like this. You know how many parks have been built in this city since he’s been Commissioner? 255. How many of those in Harlem you think? 1. You build a new beach for the ‘people’, but the ones with no cars, the poor ones, the black and brown ones?...how are they going get to the parks and beaches? Public bus. Guess how high they just built the overpasses on the new parkway? One foot too low for a bus to clear.
LAURA=>Look forget whether it’s discrimination...the Federal government and the City are being scammed! There’s supposed to be relocation services, company’s got a $2 million dollar contract to handle it but nobody even answers the phone. Call the city, they say these folks are on the list for the new public housing. But then it never gets built.
LIONEL=>You know more’n any secretary I ever met.
LAURA=>Secretary? Who told you that? I’ve got a law degree you know? I’ll pass the Bar first time I sit too.
LIONEL=>“2 million for relocation; bridges a foot too low for buses; 1 out of 255 parks; $15 mil for $500k; 200,000 people in Ft Greene alone”. I never forget anything, believe me. Not a single word.
LAURA=>It’s okay. Just write about it, okay? What happens to poor people in this city wasn’t news yesterday and it won’t be tomorrow. But you’d think somebody’d care what happens to Brooklyn. It’s only the biggest city on Earth.
LIONEL=>Where do you live?
LAURA=>Harlem.
LIONEL=>I can give you a ride. Trains’ll be mobbed.
LIONEL=>Bebop, Bailey in the Metropolitan BOPera House! Shit. Sorry.
LAURA=>Don’t be sorry, it’s kinda funny.
LIONEL=>Yeah. Hang around a little longer.
LAURA=>What is all that anyway?
LIONEL=>I don’t know. It’s like a piece of my head split off and got a life of its own but then decided to keep joyriding me for kicks. Kicks and ticks! Licks and ticks! Sorry. It’s like living with a fucking anarchist. But the flip side is its gotta have everything in its right place, everything has to sound just right or it’ll tie me into knots until I fix it. Like I’m talking to you but that piece of my head? It’s worrying that the bills in my wallet aren’t all facing the same direction. It’s not fair.
LAURA=>Hey, I guess we all got our daily battles, right?
LIONEL=>Yeah, fair enough. Kiss her face all night, Bailey!
LIONEL=>I really am sorry, I don’t mean nothing by it
LAURA=>It’s alright. Really it’s alright
LAURA=>This is me.
LIONEL=>That must keep you up nights.
LAURA=>My father owns this place. I grew up falling asleep in the back of clubs.
LIONEL=>Pretty hopping on a Monday night.
LAURA=>Yeah, hottest band in the world, all week. I gotta check on one or two things, but...look, are you really interested...in what I was telling you?
LIONEL=>I came looking for you didn’t I?
LAURA=>If you want to come in I can give you a lot more.
BEATNIK=>Excuse me, sir...?
TRUMPET=>Suckin’ off little white boys like you. Get the fuck outta here...
LIONEL=>SO WHAT, Whitey White Suck Stick!
TRUMPET=>Whitey White Suck stick! ‘So what’ is right...
TRUMPET=>How y’all doing tonight? It’s good to be home. We been traveling the world, learning new languages. With new language comes new ideas. We gonna try a few of them on y’all tonight. So strap in.
TRUMPET=>Uh oh, there’s my favorite baby girl, looking pretty as a Rose...
LIONEL=>This isn’t a good idea. I don’t think I can do this.
TRUMPET=>Don’t get too cozy. That was your last break.
BILLY=>You think I don’t know who you work for, cracker?
LIONEL=>You got it wrong--Scaredy Cat! Cracker Jack! Blackie Black!
BILLY=>I made it through Iwo Jima, motherfucker! You think your boss scares me? You tell him I see any you suits round her again I’ll kill you one at a time, then I’ll mail what he’s lookin’ for to the Post for free!
LIONEL=>Help...Hep! Hep!
TRUMPET=>You was pretty hep in there my man.
MINNA=>Remember what I said.
LIONEL=>Shit...sorry. I don’t even know what happened.
TRUMPET=>You had a good time, that’s what happened. We had a party. Different mix of people than the usual. The ‘etrange melange’ she calls it.
TRUMPET=>Figured you could use a little rest so we let you be.
LIONEL=>I remember that guy’s footprint on my ribs. Thanks for bailing me out of there.
TRUMPET=>Sarge is a good man...but you gotta watch it round a man’s family...you know?
LIONEL=>Sarge?
TRUMPET=>Billy.
LIONEL=>Why you call him ‘Sarge’?
TRUMPET=>How you think his arm got so fucked up? Colored Marine unit. Carrying ammo ‘til he picked up a gun and helped stop some Jap suicide attack. Got hit though.
TRUMPET=>Damn shame too cause he could really play. Trombone. Jammed with us at Minton’s a lot in ‘40. Came back from the war sour as hell. I told him switch to trumpet...said I’d get him a left-hander made. Said he lost his mojo. Got himself a club.
LIONEL=>You ever meet his wife?
TRUMPET=>Nah, Sarge never married.
LIONEL=>Laura’s mother...?
TRUMPET=>I don’t know about any of that. It was always just him and Laura, she was just a little thing hanging out in the kitchen and reading while we played. You play?
LIONEL=>Music? No.
TRUMPET=>I’m not to keen on people being vocal while we playing, but you were scatting on the line. I could hear it.
LIONEL=>On the line, Lionel! Lionel’s on the line! Shit. I’m sorry about that. I have something wrong with my head. The music really set it off. I’m sorry.
TRUMPET=>Don’t be sorry. You got a head just like mine. Always boiling over, turning things around. That’s music...runs you more’n you run it when it gets up in you.
TRUMPET=>Some people call it a gift but it’s a brain affliction just the same.
LIONEL=>Yeah, but I just twitch and shout. At least you got a horn to push it through, make it sound pretty.
TRUMPET=>Yeah but there’s a lotta other hours in the day though, you know what I’m sayin’? Too many!
LIONEL=>Thanks for helping me out. You ever need a ride anywhere or help with anything, give me a call.
LIONEL=>Mrs. Horowitz...?
GABBY=>I know Jake Gleason, you’re not...
LIONEL=>Sorry, Jake, brought me to the Hamilton Housing hearing.
LIONEL=>I’m a new writer for the Times and I’m very interested in this story.
GABBY=>Really. I thought being the press office for the Borough Authority was more the business of the Times than exposing them. Seeing as your publisher is an investor in the bank that gets to float the Authority’s bonds at preferred rates.
LIONEL=>I’m not saying I can get it A-1 but if I don’t do the legwork, I can’t try can I?
GABBY=>Well, someone’s going to win a Pulitzer off Title 1, so maybe it’ll be you.
LIONEL=>IF!
GABBY=>Yes, it’s a big ‘if’. Laura’s gone ahead to the protest, you can come with me if you want.
GABBY=>I brought the New York Times!
REFORMER #2=>I want you to give it up for our next speaker. She wears granny glasses but don’t be fooled! She is a PIT BULL for the people! And she taught me more about fighting the good fight than anyone. Let’s not mince words because the moment we are living in calls for naming things as they are! This is not a program of slum removal, it is a program of Negro removal! Now let’s hear from Gabby Horowitz!
GABBY=>What is a City? Is it a place where people slave for the Lords of steel and concrete? A corral for the Druids of Finance to fleece mankind in? NO! The City is its people, it is its Communities! The City is built to serve US!
LIEBERMAN=>We may have an issue with our friend from Brooklyn.
RANDOLPH=>How so?
LIEBERMAN=>He’s not here for this meshugas, he’s not that brave...but he still might not go along with the vote. Says his constituency is up in arms...
RANDOLPH=>We made him Borough President, we put him on the Board of Estimate. We're his constituency. Don't tell me he won't go along...
RANDOLPH=>Let’s go have lunch.
LAURA=>Jake! Hey Jake!!
LIONEL=>Ah the disappearing lady...
LAURA=>I’m so sorry...I own you an explanation..
LIONEL=>Nah, you don’t owe me nothing. I’m used to it.
LAURA=>No I want to explain.
LIONEL=>You gotta go.
LAURA=>I’ll be up at the club tonight later. Meet me there.
LIONEL=>I’ll see if I can
LAURA=>Come.
PAUL=>The reporter who never reports...
LIONEL=>I’m still putting the pieces together.
PAUL=>You need me to write it for you? Jeez you’re not too ambitious are you? Okay here’s your next headline: “New Expressway Will be the World’s Biggest Parking Lot.”
LIONEL=>Why?
PAUL=>Because cars are a cancer and roads make them metastasize not shrink. We need trains but he’s killing the trains.
LIONEL=>Why?
PAUL=>Always with the ‘why?’ Because he doesn’t control the revenue from trains, he controls the tolls on bridges and roads. Borough Authority. You know what an Authority is? Neither did anybody else. He invented it. A 4th branch of government...a shadow branch... with independent revenue that is the only reliable financing for public works, all controlled by him meaning he controls everything and yet nobody ever voted for him and they can’t vote him out.
LIONEL=>What could stop him?
PAUL=>Almost nothing. And he’s more dangerous now than ever.
LIONEL=>Why now?
PAUL=>Because the Board of Estimate votes on his highway and slum clearance plans this week! So he’s breaking out all his dirt on people. Bullying everyone into submission. He is the most powerful person in the history of this City! He is a autocratic Caesar. And nobody realizes it. They’re all walking around calm as Hindu cows, thinking they live in a Democracy so what could go wrong?. Now are you going to write it or what?!
LIONEL=>If you’ve got the goods why don’t you take him down?
PAUL=>‘Cause it can’t be me!
LIONEL=>Cause you’re his brother?
PAUL=>‘Cause I’ve still got dreams. That’s why. Dreams I’m this close to realizing. My contribution to society...my legacy! I won’t risk it. Okay here, look at Belmont Developers and Inwood Residential.
LIONEL=>What’s that?
PAUL=>Christ, I’m giving you the goods! A map to the scoop of the decade...Do your own damn job! Do the job! I got enough problems...
CLERK=>Oh sorry, I’ll need your name and social security number.
LIONEL=>I’m not checking it out, I’m gonna look at it right here...
CLERK=>Sure, yeah...but, um...see... parties wishing to review incorporation materials of city contractors have to register with Construction Commissioner’s office.
LIONEL=>That can’t be legal. Eagle! Beagle! Bagel!
CLERK=>Not really a law, more of a rule, Mr....
LIONEL=>Gleason.
LIONEL=>IF! IF!
SECRETARY=>May I help you?
LIONEL=>You have the applications for relocation?
SECRETARY=>Yeah, just there!
LIONEL=>And I can mail those in?
SECRETARY=>In person applications only, just there.
LIONEL=>So they have you running this whole operation all by yourself, do they?
LIONEL=>PINK TITS! You have a good evening.
LOU=>People’s trash remains private property until its collected. Anybody ever tell you that?
LIONEL=>Giant Faggot Munchkin Meat!
LOU=>Jeez, I was told to go easy and I did. But now you made me go and do this.
LIONEL=>They’re not even pretending, they’re just collecting the checks and then throwing these people’s lives in the trash. These guys make Tammany look like AA ball, I’m telling you.
CONEY=>We coulda used youse in Korea, Lionel...
LIONEL=>Why’s that?
CONEY=>Cause ya talk Chinese better’n half the chinks in the city...
LIONEL=>Chinky, Chunky Chowder! Go to hell, Coney. Lunk-a-loaf, Beef Brain!
TONY=>Go get him an aspirin, Gil... Coney folds a straight if the cards aren’t all the same color. Don’t pay no attention to him. Look, people cut deals with the pols for contracts, what else is new? Kicking up the chain, it’s the nature of things...
LIONEL=>They’re not making deals with politicians, they’re making deals with themselves! They own the companies they’re giving contracts to! It ain’t kickbacks, it’s Grand Larceny... Land a Farce on me! Don’t fart on my land, Man!
TONY=>Calm down... You got any weed? Give ‘im a smoke.
LIONEL=>Minna said this was the biggest gravy train of the century and it all goes down in two days.
DANNY=>Okay...so it’s big stuff but how was Frank mixed up in it?
LIONEL=>Every one of the officers of the Borough Authority is gonna make millions on this deal. But none of it ties to him.
TONY=>To Frank?
LIONEL=>To Randolph!
TONY=>The Parks Commissioner?
LIONEL=>It’s all about him. The girl has the line on the scam, she’s been digging into those companies for Horowitz. I think she found something that ties Randolph right to the money. Frank was following her and he figured it out and he took it in to Lieberman and his goons and showed em he had a signature. I’m telling you, Frank had something that nails Randolph.
LIONEL=>C’mon! Where did we lose em? On the Borough Bridge, for chrissake! They had a pass! Those guys were BA! The Borough Authority killed Frank!
TONY=>Alright...alright, calm down. Fuckin’ Lionel...I think you’re on the sniff. I do. But what’s the angle on the guy at the club? Her father. What was Frank doing talking to him?
LIONEL=>I got no idea...part makes no sense to me. But he knows something.
TONY=>Go home. Let me do some calling around.
LIONEL=>Who you gonna call?
TONY=>Will you just trust me and let me run with it?
LIONEL=>Frank was the only person I knew who thought the way we won the war was gonna cause us problems. He said after the Crash we were digging ourselves out by taking care of each other. But now that we’d seen what we could do with our brute strength, there was no going back. He said ‘From here on out, the game’s gonna be about Power, from top to bottom.’
LIONEL=>Yeah...
BILLY’S VOICE=>I know who you are.
LIONEL=>Who’s this?
LIONEL=>Who’s Minna?
BILLY’S VOICE=>Don’t bullshit me, motherfucker. You gave your number to the man with the horn. You know who this is now?
LIONEL=>Yeah. Okay. So what?
BILLY’S VOICE=>Sorry for roughing you up. Thought you was one of them BA goons. Where’s the envelope?
LIONEL=>I don’t know. What’s in it?
BILLY’S VOICE=>Hold on...
LIONEL=>What, now?
BILLY’S VOICE=>Yeah now!
LIONEL=>Billy?
LIONEL=>Billy...? You hear that?
DETECTIVE=>So he told you to come and then bumped himself so you could find him before staff came in probably.
LIONEL=>I already told you, I didn’t just find him...I heard it happen. He didn’t shoot himself...SHOOT MY SHIT, BAILEY!... Somebody shot him and set it up to look like he punched out. I heard ‘em leave.
DETECTIVE=>Uh huh. Powder burn on his shirt. Point blank. Neighbors telling us he had money problems...Seems pretty straightforward, friend.
LIONEL=>The gun’s in his right hand.
DETECTIVE=>So.
LIONEL=>He’s got a dead right arm, ace. War wound. He can’t lift a Zippo with it let alone a .38. You wanna show me how he shot himself in the heart with his left hand and then handed it off to his right before he punched out?
DETECTIVE=>Guy went out in his own joint, center stage with the lights and all. Gotta give him credit. I respect his style.
LIONEL=>They usually put Division dicks on dawn patrol in Harlem?
DETECTIVE=>Oh, we go wherever we’re needed. We done?
LAURA=>Oh no...Oh NOOOOO!
LAURA=>I can’t think of the last time I saw him smile...But...why would he do that...to himself...?
LIONEL=>He didn’t. Someone wanted it to look that way.
LAURA=>Man was angry as long as I can remember. But nobody hated him like that...nobody.
LIONEL=>Same people did it to a friend of mine.
LAURA=>You got no idea...
LIONEL=>You want me to?
LIONEL=>IF! Ah, sorry... I don’t know what happened...didn’t mean to fall asleep. Sorry.
LAURA=>It’s okay...I appreciate you staying.
LIONEL=>Listen, I know how you’re feeling, I really do. Pretty soon you’re gonna hear his voice in your head telling you to pull yourself together and get moving. And when you do, you’ll feel him smiling again.
LAURA=>Why you being so nice to me?
LIONEL=>Cause I think you’re a good person. You actually care about what happens to other people. And you try to make a difference. That’s a good way to be.
LAURA=>You’re sweet.
LIONEL=>Well, that isn’t how most people describe me when they meet me, but I’m glad if you think so. IF!
LAURA=>Anybody ever told you you talk in your sleep?
LIONEL=>I never slept with anybody.
LAURA=>You never slept with anybody?
LIONEL=>I been with girls...just, not the kind that stay to sleep.
LAURA=>Who’s Frank?
LIONEL=>What?
LAURA=>You said that name in your sleep. You seemed...upset. Was he your friend who got...?
LIONEL=>I worked with him...I worked for him. I knew him since I was 12. I was at that Catholic Home for Boys on DeKalb.
LIONEL=>They threw me in there when I was 6, after my mother died. Frank kinda..took me under his wing.
LAURA=>We all need someone looking out for us.
LIONEL=>That your mother? She was beautiful.
LAURA=>She died a long time ago. I don’t remember her. I guess we both got nobody now.
LIONEL=>Listen...I gotta ask you... Are you holding something out?
LAURA=>What?
LIONEL=>On Hamilton...you and Horowitz. These BA goons are scared of something big. Something that ties all this fraud you been digging around right to the top man. Do you know what it is?
LAURA=>No...I mean, somebody’s getting rich but...no...
LIONEL=>If you’re holding some card and you’re waiting to play it to block that vote, you’re playing a dangerous game. They already killed Frank and your father for it...
LAURA=>What’s Billy got to do with it?
LIONEL=>Billy knew something about it. He and my friend together...
LAURA=>That’s not possible...he doesn’t even...he didn’t even know what I’m working on. I got an uncle knows Gabby that got me that job.
LIONEL=>No, and my name’s not Jake,it’s Lionel...look...Frank was an investigator. They hired him to keep tabs on your committee. He was following you. I started poking around it to figure out who did to him, now...I’ve just got glass in my brain. I don’t even know what I’m after.
LAURA=>Gabby’s expecting me. We’re preparing her testimony before the vote...it’s important but...
LAURA=>I need to make arrangements, a funeral...
LIONEL=>All that can wait cause if I’m right the Coroner’s office won’t release the body to you yet. Get one of the guys from the club to take you down there. Then stay around people you know until I come and get you, alright?
RANDOLPH=>You know who I am?
LIONEL=>I been asking around about that but everybody seems to have a different answer.
RANDOLPH=>Ha! Spoken like a true snoop!
LIONEL=>What’s your take on it?
RANDOLPH=>Easy. I’m a builder.
LIONEL=>I can see that...
RANDOLPH=>When I was a boy you know how many bridges there were on and off Manhattan Island? Two. A shitty old train trestle here and... The Brooklyn Bridge. And when you walked across that you were stepping in horse dung most of the way. You mostly scuttled into New York off a dock...like a rat. I built that...
LIONEL=>They’re nice bridges, I’ll give you that.
RANDOLPH=>Thank you. And I want you to give me something else...if you find it. Have you found it?
LIONEL=>What’s in it?
RANDOLPH=>Slander. Falsehood. Forgery, most likely.
LIONEL=>Then you got nothing to worry about, the law’s on your side.
RANDOLPH=>Very little that I have achieved in my life has relied on legality. I don’t intend to lean on that slender branch now when things matter most.
LIONEL=>You’re above the law?
RANDOLPH=>No, no...I’m ahead of it.
LIONEL=>What’s the difference?
RANDOLPH=>Law’s just a rule book we make for the world we find ourselves in. You rebuild a city, you have to push ahead into a new world that most people can’t even envision yet... then the law follows along and adapts to what you’ve done.
LIONEL=>Who you rebuilding it for?
RANDOLPH=>The future. The people to come.
LIONEL=>Sounds great unless you’re a person who’s in the way now.
RANDOLPH=>Central Park: Greatest urban park in the world. They started building it when there wasn’t even a city past 57th St. They kicked out farmers and tenant squatters, sheep herders out of muddy fields and filth. They moved some trees. And people protested the loss of goddam ‘countryside’. But if one man hadn’t been able to SEE AHEAD to what we’d need, this city’d be unlivable today, wouldn’t it? Yes it would.
RANDOLPH=>People don’t even know Fred Olmsted’s name but they should thank him every day. I do. The important thing in life is to Get Things Done. Those who can, build. Those who can't, criticize. But I won’t obstruct the great work of the world because some chipmunks start screeching about having to relocate their nuts.
LIONEL=>Screech-a-munk-nut-chip!
RANDOLPH=>Talent and brains get rewarded in this building, Lionel. Work with us on this and I’ll see to it personally that your gifts are appreciated.
LIEBERMAN=>It’s funny...We read it wrong.
LIONEL=>How’s that?
LIEBERMAN=>We didn’t make you for the Ace in Minna’s deck.
DANNY=>You good?
LIONEL=>No. Loosey Goose Thready Head Fucks!!
DANNY=>Jesus, calm down...what’s up?
LIONEL=>There’s a loose thread, Danny. It’s making my brain hurt...I can’t...
DANNY=>Huh?
LIONEL=>SHUTTER BUG SHIT! You said you took a whole roll...where’s the rest?
DANNY=>In the darkroom...That’s all the ones of her. Everything else was before she showed...
LIONEL=>DAMMIT!!
DANNY=>You said to ID the girl!!!
LIONEL=>Where are the cars?!
DANNY=>Coney and Tony got em both...
DANNY=>What’d I miss?!
LAURA=>Where are we goin---
LIONEL=>Who is that? With your father?
LAURA=>Where did you--?
LIONEL=>Answer the question. Do you know who that is?
LAURA=>Paul. Paul Morris.
LIONEL=>Paul ‘Morris’? Is that the ‘uncle’ who got you this job?
LAURA=>My father...
LIONEL=>Your father and your ‘Uncle Paul’ are into this together..
LAURA=>No...
LIONEL=>Yes, goddam it. Are you in it too...?
LAURA=>No...that’s not my father with my uncle Paul... It’s my Uncle Billy with my father...Paul.
LIONEL=>He’s using you. He’s using you to get back at his brother.
LAURA=>I don’t think he’s got family.
LIONEL=>His name’s not Morris...it’s Randolph. Moses Randolph is his brother. He’s using you to blackmail him...
LAURA=>That’s not...
LIONEL=>Stay here until I come to find you.
LAURA=>That’s not possible...!
LIONEL=>You know what that tells me? You and Billy set this up with Minna to try to blackmail Moses...
PAUL=>Hang on--
LIONEL=>It’s you who found whatever they’re scared of. You’ve finally got something bad enough to sink your brother so you gave it to Minna to put it in play cause you thought if you hid behind Frank you could do the damage and still get your engineering plan picked. And you made it look like it came from Laura so you could hide behind her too! But people are getting killed if you didn’t notice!
LIONEL=>She’s your own daughter and her life’s at stake now because of--
PAUL=>You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about!! You know how many times I could have sunk him?! He sunk me! HE SUNK ME!!
LIONEL=>SINK A SONG OF SUNK MEN!!!
PAUL=>‘Hide behind her’? I gave up everything for her...everything I could have accomplished...my whole goddam life...
LIONEL=>Is that what it was about between you and him? You were with her mother and he hates colored--
PAUL=>I will NOT discuss such things with you! I knew you weren’t a reporter. Load ‘a shit. You’re Minna’s guy. I’m sorry for you but it was NOT me. Frank put it all together...he and Billy thought they could get something out of it. Foolish greed. I tried to stop them. I told them it would put her at risk. All of them...now look. Frank gets killed, Billy panics and calls me...that’s your picture!
LIONEL=>Frank Frankady Franko! What’s it about, Frank?
MINNA=>I gotta keep this one under my hat, boys.
LIONEL=>IF!
LIONEL=>Ah Frank...Frank Frankady Franko.
PAUL=>You found it.
LIONEL=>There’s only one way I can make sense of it.
PAUL=>Yes. I signed it. Billy brought her to our family’s home. Our servants tried to send them away and Billy started yelling. We were at dinner with our mother, for godsake. I followed Mo to the door. He scorned them, refused to acknowledge, but I saw the truth in her face. And his. The way he looked at her.
PAUL=>Even 6 months gone, she was beautiful. He sent them away with threats. But I followed them. I got them to take some money...later got a doctor.
LIONEL=>You confronted him about it.
PAUL=>I begged him. I invoked every principle and value we had been raised to champion. I was...in anguish. You can’t understand...Our whole young life, he was my hero. We wrote our Creed. We were going to fix the world together... but to serve people, you have to love people. Mo tried but he was so brilliant that he resented lesser minds and he became hard. Obsessed with winning and addicted to power. Totally contemptuous of...ideals. This phony 'man of the people’... The Jews call a man who's not what he seems to be an ‘apicoris’. That's a dangerous thing, when people aren't seen for what they really are...a very dangerous thing.
LIONEL=>Apicorpricot! Apple core it!
PAUL=>Right.
LIONEL=>Nobody else knows who she is?
PAUL=>Not even Horowitz.
LIONEL=>Why?
PAUL=>She’d have used it. And used it to good effect.
PAUL=>But it would devastate Laura. Totally. Satisfaction won’t unburden a tortured heart...so I can hold it...and so can you...please.
LIONEL=>It's in a Penn Station locker. If anything happens to me, mail it to Jacob Gleason at the Post.
PAUL=>The Post is a rag...
LIONEL=>Yeah but the Times is in Randolph’s pocket too. I gotta go get her out of town until after that vote.
TONY=>Heya, Lionel.
LIONEL=>What are you doing here, Tony?
TONY=>Watching your back. Whaddya say we get a drink?
LIONEL=>How long you been following me?
TONY=>I wasn’t. They put me on his building. I saw you come along.
LIONEL=>‘They’?
TONY=>Let’s don’t bullshit each other, you been talking to em too.
LIONEL=>Not working for em. Were you following me when Billy said he’d mail it? You tell em that? They killed him and he didn’t even have it. But why try to figure any of it out? You’re just moving up, right?
TONY=>Seven and Seven. Have a drink, Lionel.
LIONEL=>Hot water. Tea bag on the side. Sugar and Milk on the side. Very hot. HOT SUGAR TITS MILKY TEA FACE!
TONY=>Don’t pay him no mind, doll. There’s something wrong with his head.
LIONEL=>There’s nothing wrong with my head.
TONY=>Coulda fooled me.
LIONEL=>How long you been fucking Julia? After all he did for you? You can’t find someone else to bang?
TONY=>Everybody's got a find their own way in the world, Lionel. You think I was going to hang in Frank's shadow all my life? Okay for you, not for me. Not for her.
WAITRESS=>Careful...
TONY=>C’mon, let's have a real drink, Lionel. What’s the big fuckin’ deal? We help em get what they want and get on a new ride. An easier ride for once. After all the shit we had to survive just to grow up? We’re due an easy gig. You especially. C’mon I know you got a talent and I'll make sure there's a place for you. Be real partners.
LIONEL=>I’ll think about it after tomorrow. I got something I gotta go take care--
TONY=>Don’t go up to Harlem tonight, Freakshow.
LIONEL=>No. No, I found it. I’ve got what they want. Tony, call em off.
TONY=>It’s the last loose end and it’s outta my hands anyway. Now let’s just have a drink--
LIONEL=>149th and St Nicholas. Harlem. Floor it, I got money!
LOU=>Son of a bitch!
LIONEL=>There’s another one downstairs. Come on...
LIONEL=>She doesn’t know! SHE DOESN’T KNOW!
LOU=>That offer expired. And they said you were smart...
TRUMPETER=>Motherfucker, smoked my best horn.
LIONEL=>I want to see him alone. Yeah, right now. Try anything funny and tomorrow will be the worst day you’ve had in a long time.
TRUMPET=>I always like a night drive.
LIONEL=>Go with them. You’ll be safe at this place tonight.
LAURA=>What don’t I know?
LIONEL=>It wasn’t the story she wanted to hear. And no good would come from telling it, so I wanted to say ‘It doesn’t matter. It’s got nothing to do with you.’ But there’s no upside in lying to a woman who’s smarter than you, so I told her the truth...
LIONEL=>Frank told me once if you’re up against someone bigger than you, someone you can’t beat toe to toe: make em think you respect their size and cut a deal that lets you walk out in one piece. Then figure out a way to stick it to em later without leaving your prints on the knife. Even walking in there I wasn’t sure exactly how to play it. I just hoped in all the steam he wouldn’t see me sweating.
LIONEL=>Who’s the fucking Boss now, Bailey! Who’s the boss!
RANDOLPH=>So what is it with you?
LIONEL=>I got somethin’ wrong with my head. Didn’t your goons fill you in yet?
RANDOLPH=>I don’t care about your fucking affliction. I mean what's your angle in this? What do you want for that file?
LIONEL=>I want to hear your version of it.
RANDOLPH=>Why?
LIONEL=>Let’s just say an unfinished puzzle makes my head hurt, more’n most people.
RANDOLPH=>I smooth it all out for your pain in the ass brain...we putting this to bed tonight?
LIONEL=>It’s you best shot.
LIONEL=>You raped her?
RANDOLPH=>I moved on her that first time. But I treated her well...gave her things. I saw to it that the Party used that hotel a lot for a few years. She could have disappeared any time. Stopped working there. But she didn’t. She was shy but she knew how things worked and she was always grateful.
RANDOLPH=>Then buddy the Dodgers can take it on the arches to the fucking coast and I'll get a new team that plays ball with ME, in MY stadium. And if I want to fuck a colored girl in a hotel room now and then because I'm feeling like a wrecking ball then, pal, I'm gonna do it. And if you think I'm gonna let some little chip who never should have been born, or your small time boss or my brother and his ideals and his forgeries in my name slow down what I'm GETTING DONE in this city, you gotta lot to learn about how power works. Cause all those people are invisible...they don't even exist.
LIONEL=>See if you feel that way tomorrow when they blow up your big vote.
RANDOLPH=>She know?
LIONEL=>Name it! CLAIM it! Shame it! That blackmailing gumshoe was my friend and that girl is the only reason you’re still breathing.
LIONEL=>Do what you want to the city. Build your pyramids on the Nile. But you leave her alone. Anything happens to her, it gets mailed.
RANDOLPH=>Make no mistake, you or Paul messes with what I intend to get done and I'll make her life even worse than I made his. You tell him I said that.
LIONEL=>I guess we’ve got a deal. So I’ll give you one for free. You man Lieberman is gonna cause you problems.
RANDOLPH=>How so?
LIONEL=>He owns a piece of half the companies doing contracts with slum clearance. And I’m guessing he hasn’t told you about that. So when you ‘handle’ him...tell him it was me that told you and that that’s for Frank.
RANDOLPH=>Son of a bitch. You come off weird, but you’re smart. You should’ve taken my offer. You could’ve made em all get on their knees and apologize.
RANDOLPH=>SON OF A BITCH!
LIONEL=>Growing up, I always thought Frank was a hero but he was no crusader in the end. He was just a gumshoe trying to make a buck like everyone else. But he didn’t have to go to that war.
LIONEL=>He was old enough to have skipped it and he went anyway because he actually thought this country was worth fighting for. I never had anything I cared about enough to look past my own problems. But Laura did. There was a story she wanted told and I figured it was time to get off my ass and pick a side.
NEWSBOY=>Gleason...for you
LIONEL=>You crazy? It’s freezing out.
LAURA=>What is this place?
LIONEL=>It was Frank’s. Looks like it’s mine now.
LAURA=>Still looking out for you after all. Funny how things turn out.
LIONEL=>“Brooklyn’s big, but there’s things even bigger.”
LAURA=>What’s that?
LIONEL=>I think it’s something Frank said to me but I can’t remember when.
LAURA=>Maybe this is what he meant.
LIONEL=>If! IF!
