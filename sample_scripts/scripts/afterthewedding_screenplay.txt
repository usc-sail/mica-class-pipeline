1   EXT. CALCUTTA INDIA. FROM ABOVE - MORNING                   1

    We soar above the busy, dilapidated city, towards the
    outskirts of town, where we close in on the remnants of
    what looks like an ancient, abandoned temple.


2   INT./EXT. DILAPIDATED TEMPLE, OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY         2

    ISABEL (39), leads a meditation. She’s not native to this
    part of the world, though her skin is deeply tanned and
    her hair is streaked from the sun.

    Her eyes are closed and she emits a subtle chanting
    sound. Her lids flutter and her eyes open and look right
    at us.

    WHAT SHE SEES:

    Sitting facing her, are a dozen Indian children
    attempting to meditate. One lies on his back looking up
    at his hands, pretending they are a bird, flying over
    head. Isabel stands and walks to him.

    She kneels next to him and looks at his bird-hands. After
    a moment, she lies next to him. She whispers in
    ‘Bengali’.

                           ISABEL
                    (In Bengali)
              What kind of bird is that?

    The 7 year old boy, JAI, looks at her and shrugs his
    shoulders. Isabel puts her hands up in the air and makes
    a bird of her own. They fly together.

                           ISABEL (CONT’D)
                    (Bengali)
              Why don’t you sit up and meditate with
              the others and you can imagine as many
              birds as you like.

                           JAI
                    (Bengali)
              I don’t want to close my eyes today.

    Isabel examines his precious face.

                           ISABEL
              OK. But help me with the bell.

    Jai smiles and excitedly scampers to his feet. He puts
    his hands out to help Isabel up.

      Jai goes to the front of the room and grabs a bell. He
      looks to Isabel in anticipation, and she nods.

      With all his might, he shakes the bell and a low ring
      emanates, signaling the meditation is over.

      The others open their eyes. Jai laughs at their surprised
      expressions as they see it’s him with the bell.


3     EXT. DILAPIDATED TEMPLE - DAY                               3

      Like the pied piper, Isabel leads the children out of the
      beautiful but broken down temple, back into the rundown
      village streets.

      TITLE: AFTER THE WEDDING


4     EXT. CALCUTTA STREET, IMPOVERISHED AREA - LATER THAT DAY    4

      Isabel, Jai, and a few other children from the orphanage,
      ride in the back of an open pick up truck down a dusty
      street.

      A group of hungry local children chase the truck as it
      pulls up in an open square and stops.

      The driver gets out and the local kids surround the
      truck. Isabel and the orphans begin their routine of
      serving a meal from giant pots; rice and lentils. The
      hungry children wait with cups and get food ladled in.


5     INT. BACK OF TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON                         5

      The exhausted group rides back toward the orphanage. The
      sun has just set and the sky is a silvery blue. Jai is
      glued to Isabel’s side as they all sing a song.


6     INT./ EXT. ORPHANAGE - EVENING                              6

      Isabel’s truck pull in.

      A French aid worker, JAQUES (Late 40’s), is laying out
      some supplies he has brought in a van. Isabel’s truck
      pulls in and she hops out, anxiously.

                              ISABEL
                       (to Jaques)
                 What did you get?

      She blows by him to check out the supplies.

                              JAQUES
                       (sarcastically)
                 It’s nice to see you...

      Isabel looks through what he’s brought. She picks up some
      sheets.

                              ISABEL
                 Where are the beds? The food? And there
                 were supposed to be school supplies.

                              JAQUES
                 We can hang hammocks. Temporarily.

      A beat as they look at each other.

                              JAQUES (CONT'D)
                 It’s all I could get. For the money.

      She looks at him slightly confused, then shakes her head
      and marches away.


7     INT. ORPHANAGE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER                       7

      Isabel marches in.

                              ISABEL
                 Where’s the money we were promised? How
                 long are we supposed to wait?

      The director of the orphanage, PREENA (60’s), sits at her
      desk, going over some paperwork. She removes her glasses
      and takes a deep breath.

                              PREENA
                 They want you to go meet with them.

                               ISABEL
                 What?

                              PREENA
                 In New York. To tell them why we are a
                 worthy cause.

      Isabel is taken aback.

                              ISABEL
                 How many hoops are we supposed to jump
                 through?

      Preena watches her.
     Pink Rev. (05/28/18)             BF7                           4.


                               PREENA
                  Their money, their terms.

       This infuriates Isabel.

                               ISABEL
                  Well, I’m not going to go teach
                  compassion when the kids need me here.
                  Tell them to go save the fucking whales.

       Isabel heads out the door.

                               PREENA
                  They want to give us 2 million dollars.

       Isabel is stopped by the number. She and Preena look at
       each other.


8      EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, OYSTER BAY, LONG ISLAND - LATE           8
       AFTERNOON

       From above, we follow a luxury sedan as it wends it’s way
       down a country road.


9      INT. THERESA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             9

       THERESA YOUNG (51), drives her car while the radio
       blasts, Lady Gaga. She speeds around a turn, then down a          *
       narrow strip of road, bordered by a beautiful bay.


10     EXT. THERESA’S DRIVEWAY - SAME                              10

       A big beautiful estate, with gorgeous landscaping and a
       few impressive sculptures scattered around the grounds.

       Theresa’s car winds its way down the driveway.


11     INT. THERESA’S CAR - DAY                                    11

       As the car approaches the house, Gaga is interrupted by           *
       the phone ringing.

       The screen in the car reads: OFFICE.

       Theresa picks up on speaker.

                               THERESA
                  Gwen, what is it? I’m just pulling in.
     Pink Rev. (05/28/18)           BF7                             5.


       The voice of GWEN, Theresa’s assistant comes through the
       speaker.

                               GWEN
                  I have Simon and Tanya for you.

       Theresa comes to a stop in front of the house.

                               THERESA
                  Ok, great. Put them on.

       She turns the car off and takes the call on her phone as
       she gets out.


12     EXT. THERESA’S DRIVEWAY/FRONT OF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS         12

       Theresa steps out of the car and balances her bag and a
       few files. We hear a voice leaking through the other end.

       She stands looking out at her beautiful yard while she
       listens to Tanya and Simon.

                               THERESA
                        (into the phone)
                  No, no, Tanya, it’s OK. You don’t need to
                  sell them, just guide them through it.
                  And give them all the information they
                  are asking for. What else?

       Theresa opens her front door and walks inside.


13     INT. HOUSE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS                              13

       She walks through the beautiful entryway still on the
       call.

                               THERESA
                  Hang on, we need Bill on this call.

       She puts her files down and heads toward the kitchen as
       she continues the call.


14     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               14

       Theresa walks through the gorgeous living room. Walls
       lined with art. Mid-century modern furniture, a piano. A
       fire is lit in the fire place.

                               THERESA
                        (phone)
                  Can you shoot him an email?

                               THERESA (CONT'D)
                  I don’t want to go through this twice so
                  call me tomorrow and we can go over it
                  together.


15     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                   15

       Theresa opens the door to the kitchen to find CIBELE,
       housekeeper/baby-sitter, cleaning up dinner.

       Theresa mouths “Where are the boys?”. Cibele points up
       stairs.

                               THERESA
                        (phone)
                  Gwen can you stay on a minute?

       She heads out of the kitchen.


16     INT. ESTATE HALLWAY/STAIRWAY                                16

       Theresa heads up the stairs.

                               THERESA
                        (phone)
                  Get Bill on first thing tomorrow, then
                  get me.


17     INT. HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/LANDING                         17

                               THERESA
                        (phone)
                  Is Cahill at home or in the office? Text
                  me his cell please. Thank you.

       She hangs up. Let’s her gaze linger through a window
       down onto the sprawling yard, where we see the beginnings
       of a party set up. Theresa takes a breath then:

                               THERESA (CONT’D)
                        (yelling)
                  Chickens! I’m home!


18     INT. TWIN BOY’S ROOM - EVENING                              18

       Theresa walks in to find her 8 year old twin boys, OTTO
       and THEO playing a video game.

                               THERESA
                  What’s going on here?
     Pink Rev. (05/28/18)              BF7                          7.


                               TWINS
                        (distracted by the game)
                  Hi mom.

       Theresa looks at the screen as the boys’ avatars fight
       each other.

                               THERESA
                  You know I don’t like this game.

       They groan a little.

                               TWINS
                  Dad said we could.

                               THERESA
                  Well, now mom’s home.


       MINUTES LATER

       All three sit together on the floor, the boys on either
       side of Theresa as she reads them a book. “Meet my
       staff”. She does all the voices. They lean on her.


19     INT. NEW YORK CITY ART GALLERY - EVENING                    19

       A sculpture exhibit is being installed. OSCAR CARLSON,
       (early 40’s), somewhere between artist and construction
       worker, meticulously measures, hoists, and tinkers with
       the lighting. Some movers and gallery staff stand by to
       help.

       He climbs down off the ladder and approaches a tower
       looking sculpture made of balanced rocks. He watches how
       the lights that now slowly rotate above illuminate the
       rock structure.

       He takes a step back and looks. Everyone waits.

                               OSCAR
                  It’s catching at about 12 O’clock

       He looks at the beams above where the lights hang.

                               OSCAR (CONT’D)
                  We may need to re-rig so the power cord
                  can run vertically.

       The workers take a deep breath. Oscar takes a further
       step back and we see now there is a translucent patterned
       curtain with a hole in it through which the audience is
       meant to view the sculpture through. As he looks:

       Oscar’s phone rings. “GRACIE” calling.

                               OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        (into the phone)
                  Hi Bunny.                                              *


20     INT. GALLERY/ EXT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT TERRACE              20

                               GRACE (O.S.)
                  Hi daddy.

       GRACE CARLSON is 21, pretty in a tender way. She’s
       dressed for a night out. Oscar is happy to hear from her.

                               OSCAR
                  What’s going on?

                               GRACE
                  Nothing. Just getting married this
                  weekend.

                               OSCAR
                  Yeah, not that big a deal.

       She hangs on the line. Looks behind her to a whole group
       of friends all drinking and eating together. They are
       rowdy and making a ton of noise. JONATHAN (26),
       attractive in a conservative way, beckons her back over.

                               JONATHAN
                  C’mon Grace! Milly bought us a round of
                  shots.

                               OSCAR
                  Sounds like fun over there.

                               GRACE
                  Kind of...

       She’s clearly not into it. Oscar can read her.

                               OSCAR
                        (comforting)
                  It’s going to be perfect. Mom has
                  everyone working at maximum efficiency.

       He laughs and Grace smiles warmly. A quiet moment. The
       group beckons Grace again.

                               GRACE
                  How’s the show looking?
     Pink Rev. (05/28/18)               BF7                       9.


                               OSCAR
                  Work in progress. Thanks for asking.

                               GRACE
                  Thank you daddy. I just wanted to say hi.

                                OSCAR
                  I love you.

                               GRACE
                  Love you too.

       She lets out a little excited-nervous sound. Oscar
       laughs.


21     INT./EXT OSCAR’S TRUCK - GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY - NIGHT    21

       Oscar flies down the highway with the music blaring and
       windows open. He sings.


22     EXT. CENTRE ISLAND ROAD, OYSTER BAY - HOUSE DRIVEWAY.     22

       Oscar’s truck pulls in the driveway.


23     INT. THERESA/OSCAR’S BATHROOM - NIGHT                     23

       Theresa soaks in a bubble bath with her ipad propped up
       on the side of the tub and a glass of wine in her hand.

       Oscar walks in, a puzzled look on his face.

                               OSCAR
                  What’s wrong with the boys? Why are they
                  reading?

                               THERESA
                        (takes off her glasses)
                  Did you tell them they could play mortal
                  killing?

                  Mortal Combat. I may have.

       He gives her a face. She rolls her eyes. He sits on the
       edge of the tub and leans in for a kiss.

                            OSCAR
               Never quite like I imagine.

  She’s used to hearing this.

                            THERESA
               (The work is beautiful), It’s going to be
               great. Just try to relax and enjoy it.

  He smiles at her and takes her foot out of the tub. He
  rubs it.

                            OSCAR
               Gracie, called. I think she wanted some
               reassurance. She sounded nervous.

                            THERESA
               I guess it runs in the family.

  He smiles.

                            OSCAR
               Are you nervous?

                            THERESA
               Are you nervous?

                            OSCAR
               Excuse me for a minute, I have to take
               this...

  He takes her foot and uses it like a telephone.

                            OSCAR (CONT’D)
               Hello... sorry, she’s too nervous to
               talk.

  She laughs and tries to pull her foot away.

                            THERESA
               That tickles... Seriously.

  She starts to laugh and struggle. He holds it tighter and
  bites up her leg.

  She grabs his hands to stop him. He lets himself slide
  into the tub, all his clothes on. She is shocked and lets
  out a scream of surprise. He pulls her close and they
  kiss passionately.

24     INT. ISABEL’S BEDROOM, INDIA - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT          24

       A slight breeze blows, gently swaying her curtains.
       Isabel lies in bed awake. Jaques sleeps next to her.

       A SCREAM from the other room. Isabel sits bolt upright.


25     INT. BUNK ROOM, ORPHANAGE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT             25

       About 20 beds, as well as some make shift beds on the
       floor and some hammocks.

       Jai is standing next to his bed crying.

       Isabel rushes in, followed closely by Jaques.

       Jai who looks at Isabel guiltily, then down to his
       tattered shorts which are wet in the front. Some of the
       other children sit up and look.

       Isabel goes to him. She sees the mattress is soaked
       through.

                               ISABEL
                  Jai, it’s okay...

       She tries to calm him, then turns to Jaques.

                               ISABEL (CONT’D)
                        (to Jaques)
                  Get me some sheets, OK?

       Jaques nods and exits.

                  Go back to sleep.

       She hugs Jai.

                               ISABEL (CONT’D)
                        (comforting)

26     INT. ISABEL’S BEDROOM - 3AM                                 26

       She sits on the edge of her bed, exhausted. Jaques lays a
       hand on her back.

                        (strongly)

                  I do...

       Jaques thinks.

                               JAQUES (CONT’D)
                  Why don’t I go New York and meet with
                  them? You can fill me in and I’ll take
                  them through it.

       She looks at him.

                               JAQUES (CONT'D)
                   It’s on my way to Argentina. Sort of.


27     INT. ORPHANAGE OFFICE- DAY                                  27

       Isabel and Jaques sit opposite Preena, who is on the
       phone with the money people in New York. Isabel is
       anxious to hear what they will say.

                               PREENA
                        (into the phone)
                  Yes. I understand. Of course.

       She hangs up and looks at Isabel.

                               PREENA (CONT’D)
                  It has to be you.

       Isabel gets agitated.

                               ISABEL
                  Why? That’s ridiculous.

                               PREENA
                  Are we really in a position to ask why?

       Isabel stands and walks out.


28     EXT. TRAIL THROUGH THE WOODS, NEAR THERESA AND OSCAR’S      28

       Theresa, is taking a morning walk through the woods while
       she talks on her headphones.

                                THERESA
                         (into phone)
                   What’s their response to the truncated
                   retention period?

        She listens.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   That’s not going to work. We can give on
                   the deferred compensation, but the
                   retention period is non-negotiable.

        She listens. Wider. We see the beauty of the path.

        Bill lays out the terms he’ll go back with. Theresa slows
        as she sees something up ahead. A massive tree that has
        fallen in last nights storm, split at the base of its
        trunk.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   OK, I’m on my walk. I’m going to call you
                   back from the car.

        She hangs up and approaches the tree which blocks the
        path.

        AT THE TREE: Theresa is dwarfed by it. She examines it,
        walking down the length until she gets to where it split.

        It’s a violent but beautiful sight; Splintered wood,
        roots with moss still attached pointing up to the sky,
        tree sap hanging on the points of the razor sharp breaks
        in the wood.

        She touches it in fascination. A little sap on her
        fingers. She lets them stick together.

        Then, just over to the side, she spots something else. A
        birds nest on the ground.

        Theresa goes over to it and bends close. She clears away
        some leaves to see the carefully made nest has shards of
        broken blue eggs in it. She touches one gently, then
        looks up in the sky.

        A bird circles above.

       She looks at their faces. So different from those of the
       children she’s just left. She looks out the window and
       flashes back to earlier in the day.

       Close on Isabel’s hand in Jai’s hand as they walk
       together. We wander up to his face which looks tense and
       sad.

                               JAI
                  Will you be back for my birthday?

       She looks at him tenderly.

                               ISABEL
                  What did I tell you?

                               JAI

       The children all crowd around her as she takes her bag
       and puts it in a cab.

       Jaques stands on the other side of them, looking at her.
       He gives her a wave. She offers a tense smile.

       Isabel hugs Preena.

       Isabel exits with the throngs of people. Gets to the
       other side of customs.

       A chauffeur awaits, with a sign: “Isabel Andersen”. She
       approaches. He takes her bag from her and leads the way.

       Inside the car, is every conceivable New York news
       publication. Isabel picks up “The New York Post”. Some
       horrific political scandal on the back. She puts it down
       and picks up “The Wall Street Journal: “Market Bullish
       over tax plan”. Not her world. She rolls down her window.

       From the “Kosciusko” Bridge. Manhattan in all it’s glory
       off to the west.

       The MANAGER of the hotel waits to greet Isabel. A Bellman
       at her side. As Isabel gets out, the manager approaches.

       Isabel is looking out the window at the city scape, only
       hearing half of what the manager has said.

       The Manager heads out. Isabel is left alone.

       She takes a deep breath, then walks over to the
       refrigerator and opens it. There is a ridiculous amount
       of food and drink. She shakes her head at the excess.

       A large shed like building with a little courtyard. We
       can see the house in the background.

       The courtyard and the studio are filled with sculptures
       and tools. Some are large. Some made of wood, some stone.
       There is also a kiln in the corner with blocks of clay
       and pots in various stages of being glazed.

       Oscar stains a wood piece, that stands about as tall as
       him. We can’t quite see it in it’s entirety. His phone
       rings: “Theresa”.

                  I did it.

                  Thank god. And I’m worried about the
                  lobster risotto. I think I pressured her
                  into it.

                  She needs to have something to resent us
                  about. Let it be the lobster risotto.

       Oscar breathes a sigh of relief.

                          OSCAR
             Doesn’t mean it’s a good idea...

                          THERESA
             Is this what you were thinking about when
             you were up last night?

                          OSCAR

43     INT. BOWERY HOTEL - DAY                                     43

       The elevator opens and Isabel steps out. She has cleaned
       up and wears a nicer outfit but still looks out of place.
       She carries a folder and a DVD.

       Jonathan, who we saw at the bar with Grace, approaches
       Isabel.

                               JONATHAN
                  You must be Isabel.

       She’s taken aback.

                               JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                  I’m Jonathan.

       He extends his hand and she shakes it dubiously.

                               JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                  I’m here to take you to your meeting.

       She looks at him.

                                 ISABEL
                  OK.

       They look at each other awkwardly for a moment. He smiles
       and extends his arm as if to say, ‘after you’.


44     EXT. BOWERY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS                              44

       They emerge onto the busy street.

                               JONATHAN
                  How’s the hotel? Are you comfortable?

                                 ISABEL
                  Yes.

       He seems happy.

                               JONATHAN
                  Good. I chose it myself.

       They arrive at the curb and Jonathan raises his hand,
       beckoning the Tesla which waits at the corner.

       Jonathan opens the door which swings upward, like a
       spaceship. Isabel is startled.

45     INT. TESLA - MINUTES LATER                              45

       Isabel tries to get her window down but can’t seem to
       find the right button. Jonathan helps.

                               JONATHAN
                  Is it the french spelling?

       She looks at him.

                               JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        (with accent)
                  “Isabelle.”

                                 ISABEL
                  I S A B E L.

                               JONATHAN
                  Ah, that’s not the french.

       Another awkward moment. Isabel looks out at the city.

                               JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                  Have you ever met Theresa?

                                 ISABEL
                  No.

                               JONATHAN
                  She’s very impressive. She built
                  ‘Horizon’ from nothing 22 years ago, and
                  now it’s one of the biggest media buying
                  companies in the world.

                               ISABEL
                  Media buying?

                               JONATHAN
                  We connect brands to consumers and vice
                  versa, through an understanding of
                  demographics and Psycho-graphics.

       Isabel looks at him blankly.

                               ISABEL
                  So, what do you sell?

                               JONATHAN
                  Whatever the client is selling.

       She nods, half understanding.

                    It’s Theresa’s brain child. Don’t be
                    intimidated by her. That’s a mistake.

                                 ISABEL
                    Sounds like you know her well.

       He smiles.

                                 JONATHAN
                    I’ve worked at the company for 4 years.

                                 ISABEL
                    Oh. Congratulations.

                                 JONATHAN
                          (happy)

46     INT. HORIZON WAITING AREA - DAY                             46

       Isabel sits, waiting. Modern and beautiful. Lots of
       glass. Stunning view of the city. After a moment,
       Theresa’s executive assistant, GWEN (30’s), approaches
       Isabel.

                                 GWEN
                    Isabel.

       She stands.

                    Follow me.


47     INT. HORIZON OFFICE HALLS AND STAIRS - CONTINUOUS           47

       Isabel follows Gwen down the labyrinth modern hallways -
       up a staircase, past walls of glass and employees. And
       finally:


48     INT. HALL JUST OUTSIDE THERESA’S PRIVATE CONFERENCE ROOM 48

       Gwen and Isabel arrive and stop. Glass windows allow us
       to see in.

       Inside, Theresa is just finishing up a meeting with SIMON
       (43), TANYA (55) and Bill (60), her lawyer. They have
       someone on a conference call.

                          GWEN
             Sorry, they are almost finished. Can I
             get you a water?

                          ISABEL
             No, thank you.

  A phone on Gwen’s desk rings from down the hall.

                          GWEN
             Excuse me.

  Gwen hustles to get it. Isabel waits awkwardly shifting
  her gaze between the conference room and the view out the
  window.

  We can just hear Theresa and the others though they are
  muted by the glass.

                          THERESA
                   (into the phone)
             Christine...
                   (getting irritated)
             Christine! Here is the important point.
             The valuation potentially changes if this
             leaks into next quarter. If getting it
             done quickly means conceding a few of
             these points, then do it.                              *

  Theresa sees Isabel.                                              *

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             I need to go.

             with some suggestions.                                 *

                   (to her team)
             I’m not sure why we hired someone to
             guide us through the process, who we now
             need to guide through the process.

                          TANYA
             She’s just not a great communicator. But
             she’s been through this before with other
             companies, which is valuable.

  Theresa heads out of the conference room toward Isabel.

             Okay. But can we think about

             most of the work here.

                               THERESA
                  You must be Isabel.

       Isabel nods with a tense smile and Theresa extends her
       hand.

                  Theresa.

       Theresa takes her in for a moment, then looks out the
       window.

                               THERESA (CONT’D)
                  On a clear day you can see New Jersey
                  from here. Don’t know why you’d want to.

       Isabel doesn’t get it.

                               THERESA (CONT’D)
                  Let’s go to my office.


50     INT. HORIZON, THERESA’S OFFICE                            50

       Isabel and Theresa walk in. Beautiful furniture, a wall
       of wood and a huge photograph of the ocean above her
       seating area.

                               THERESA
                  You had a long trip.

       Isabel nods.

                                 THERESA (CONT’D)
                  Please sit.

       down to it.

                          THERESA
             So, I watched the video that my group
             brought back from India.

                          ISABEL
             What’s really going on there can’t be
             understood though a video.

                          THERESA
             It gives a sense.

                          ISABEL
             There are over two hundred thousand child
             prostitutes in the south alone. And five
             times that amount suffer from
             malnutrition. The numbers triple when you
             go the bigger cities.

  Isabel takes a paper out of the folder she is holding.
  She hands it to Theresa. It has figures, numbers and
  graphs. Theresa looks at it while Isabel continues.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
                   (bitter)
             Hundreds of thousands die from minor
             illnesses, infections. Completely
             preventable, with very little money if
             someone had the inclination.

  Theresa studies her.

                          THERESA
             It’s infuriating isn’t it.

  Isabel taken back by the question.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Because it’s preventable.

  Gwen pops in.

                          GWEN
             Sorry to interrupt. I have the caterers
             on the line. They want to know if they
             can use mussels and shrimp for the
             risotto. There’s a lobster shortage.

                          THERESA
             Is there a lobster shortage, or can they
             not get enough lobster?

  She stands there.

             Well, then let me know when you find out.

  The assistant retreats to call the caterer.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             You’ve caught me at a busy time. My
             daughter is getting married this weekend.

                          ISABEL
             Yes. I met your son-in-law.

                         THERESA
             Jonathan.

  Theresa stands and picks up a framed photo of Grace.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Grace is young. But she says she’s in                *
             love. I could fight her on this and tell
             her she’s too young and have her hate me -
             I’ve tried that. Or I could give her a
             beautiful wedding.

  Theresa hands Isabel the framed picture. Isabel looks
  down at it. A beautiful picture of Grace stares back at
  her.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Do you have kids?

             Partner?                                             *

                          ISABEL
             No. My work is all consuming.

                          THERESA
             I understand. I really wanted a family.
             I think a lot of women believe it’ll just
             happen on its own.

  Isabel isn’t sure if this is a criticism.

                          THERESA (CONT'D)
             But personally, I think if you want it,
             you have to make it happen. I have 2
             little boys too. I worked hard for them.             *

  Theresa takes the picture back and replaces it on the
  shelf.

  Isabel tries to refocus the conversation. She reaches
  into her bag and pulls out another folder.

                          ISABEL
             I have a list of priorities here.
             Eventually we’d like to take in three
             times the number of children.

  Theresa glances at the folder then walks to her desk as
  Isabel continues.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             Change our food program. Subsidize and
             buy from local farmers. Vaccinate. Which
             could be done for under 5 dollars per
             child.

  Theresa nods.

                          THERESA
             What you’re doing is very impressive.
             It’s important work.

  Isabel gives a tense smile.

                          THERESA (CONT'D)
             But there are a lot of good, deserving
             organizations out there. I need some more            *
             time to think.                                       *

  Isabel is surprised and annoyed.

                          ISABEL
             What? I... I was under the impression
             that you had already decided to be
             involved.

  She grabs the graphs off of the table.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
                   (getting upset)
             Look at the information. The need is
             undeniable.

                          THERESA
             I have a big weekend ahead of me and I
             feel like I need the time. Leave the
             folder. Monday we’ll have lunch and I’ll
             let you know what I can do.

  Isabel is fuming, but holds it in.

                  In the meantime, come to the wedding. We
                  can get to know each other better.

                               ISABEL
                  I’m heading directly back to India.

                               THERESA
                  Staying the weekend won’t kill you. It’s
                  a big party. You won’t be uncomfortable,
                  I promise.

       Isabel is stuck. The door opens and her assistant comes
       in comes in.

                               THERESA (CONT’D)
                  Gwen, get Isabel an invitation to the
                  wedding.

                               GWEN
                  Right away. And Dr. Cahill is here for
                  the insurance work up.

                               ISABEL
                  I need a physical?

                               THERESA
                  Not you. Me. There are a lot of hoops to
                  jump through when you’re selling your
                  company. See you tomorrow.

       Theresa smiles at her. The doctor is shown in. Isabel
       walks out. We go with her.


51     INT. HORIZON, HALLWAYS                                    51

       Isabel makes her way out. We stay close on her as she
       makes her way through the maze like office toward the
       front. Hard to read her.

       As Isabel approaches the elevator bank, she suddenly
       bails out through the emergency exit and into the back
       stair well.

54     EXT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY AND LAWN - DAY     54

       A lot of action on the lawn. Trucks in the driveway,
       people setting up for the wedding.

       Theresa's car wends down the long driveway toward the big
       house. It stops and Theresa gets out.

       She heads across the lawn toward Oscar, who is speaking
       to the wedding planner, MELINDA. She looks slightly
       frantic.

       Before Theresa can get to them, the twins, Otto and Theo
       ambush her.

       Her face lights up as they run into her arms. She bends
       to scoop them up and they almost all topple over.

       She laughs.

                               THERESA
                  Hello my little cookies...

       She covers them in kisses. They laugh and resist - and
       love it.

                               THERESA (CONT’D)
                  Chocolate chip... and peanut butter...

                               TWINS
                  No! Not peanut butter!

                               THERESA
                  Oh that’s right, someone is allergic!
                  Sugar then...

       She pretends to eat their cheeks.

       They point to the sky where a a hi-tech drone with a
       camera mounted soars above them.

                               TWINS
                  Mom, mom. Look. The man let us fly it. I
                  was making it go.

       Theresa watches as the drone flies back to the young man
       who is controlling it.

                               THERESA
                  Wow! Just don’t fly away.

                               TWINS
                  It’s not for people! It’s going to take
                  pictures of the wedding.

       Theresa looks over at Oscar who is engaged with the
       wedding planner MELINDA.

                                THERESA
                   Ohhh I see. Have you seen your sister?

                                TWINS
                   She told us to stay away from her.

                                THERESA
                   Well, brides are crabby.

       Theresa stands.

                               THERESA (CONT'D)
                   Go ask that man if you can fly it again.

       They run off. Theresa walks to Oscar.


55     EXT. LAWN                                                55

       Theresa walks up to Oscar. They smile at each other in
       acknowledgement of how much is going on.

                                OSCAR
                   I nixed the ice sculptures. Melinda’s
                   having a fit.

       They look over at some huge ice sculptures which are
       being carried away around the side of the house.

       Melinda is frantically point to the men where to put
       them. Theresa and Oscar watch her.

                                THERESA
                   I guess this isn’t the time to tell her
                   we need one more chair.

       Oscar looks at her, quizzically.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   Somebody from work.

       Oscar sighs.

                                OSCAR
                   I think I just won’t tell her and add it
                   when she’s not looking.

       Another scream. The boys are buzzing Melinda with the
       drone. She is ducking.

                               THERESA
                  Where’s Gracie?

       Oscar looks toward the epic tent. Another kiss.


56     EXT. WEDDING AREA, BACK OF HOUSE - MINUTES LATER            56

       Lush and beautiful. Tables are being set, flowers placed.

       Theresa sees Grace counting chairs, excitedly and
       anxiously.

       Theresa takes Grace in for a moment then approaches her.
       Grace turns and sees Theresa and gives her a wide,
       nervous smile.

       Theresa smiles back. They go to each other and hug.

                               GRACE
                  Can you believe this is happening?

                               THERESA
                  No, I can’t. Are you okay? Any doubts?

                               GRACE
                  You wish.

       Theresa holds her face and looks right at her.

                               THERESA
                  No. I wish what you wish.

       Grace smiles and hugs her mom again.

                               GRACE
                  Thank you.

                               THERESA
                  I don’t see what would be so wrong with
                  just living together for a year...

       Grace has heard this before.

                               GRACE
                  Really?

                               THERESA
                  And, he’s not as good looking as you.

       She’s clearly used to this.

                               GRACE
                  Anything else?

       The look at each other deeply again.

                               THERESA
                  Yes. You’ll always be mine. Remember
                  that.

       This clearly touches Grace, but she tries to slough it
       off, but it makes her emotional.

                               GRACE
                  You are honestly the worst. And try, if
                  you can to get all of your crying done
                  before the wedding, because it sets me
                  off.

       Theresa puts her hand up like she is taking an oath.

       Theresa walks up the stairs.


58     INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S BEDROOM                            58

       Theresa enters the bedroom. She walks through the room
       into her dressing room/closet.


59     INT. THERESA’ DRESSING ROOM/CLOSET                          59

       It’s big enough to be another bedroom. Meticulously
       organized. Her dress for the wedding hangs on the far
       side of the closet, ready for tomorrow.

       She takes off her shoes.

       AT HER BUREAU, she removes her earrings and other
       jewelry. Places it on a tray.

       Next to the tray we see the bird nest with the three
       little cracked eggs in it, that she brought back from her
       walk.

       Theresa opens a drawer where she keeps a pill box with
       pills/vitamins divided into daily doses. She grabs
       “Friday”, puts the pills in her mouth, and swallows them
       without water.

       ON THE CLOSET WINDOW, we hang on an empty frame.

       Theresa walks up to the window. Expression unreadable.

       She looks out at the big oak tree. Branches outstretched
       like arms. She breathes in. Breathes out. Breathes in.
       Breathes out.

       Then out the window, what looks like a bird, flies over
       the tree. She leans closer to discover it’s the drone. It
       flies high above the tree, swooping this way and that. We
       hear the children’s giggles from below.

       Theresa closes her eyes and we see:


       THE DRONE POV

       Swooping, beautiful aerials of the tree, the house, the
       people below. And it climbs, up, and up, and up.

       BACK ON THERESA

       She opens her eyes and her face breaks into a cry. She
       covers her mouth to muffle it.

       the phone with Jai.

                               ISABEL
                  Yes, it’s big. But also small. All the
                  buildings are squeezed together into a
                  small, small space.

                               JAI
                  Would I like it?

       She seems to actually reflect on the question. Looks out.

                               ISABEL
                  One day maybe you will see it for
                  yourself.

                               JAI
                  Are there birds?

       Isabel looks out at the pigeons.

                               ISABEL
                  Kind of. But not like we are used to.

  She stands and looks through the glass into the room
  where two Housekeepers have let themselves in.


  VIEW INSIDE THE ROOM

  Housekeepers are followed by the Hotel Manager. They
  carry 2 different dresses on hangers.

  Isabel looks puzzled. The Manager waves and directs
  Housekeeping to hang the dresses so they are on display.

                          JAI
             When will you be back?

  Isabel looks through the window at the dresses.

                          ISABEL
             As soon as I can. But you need to set an
             example for the others while I’m gone.

  He nods, though of course she can’t see it.

                          ISABEL (CONT'D)
             Can you hand the phone to Preena?

                          JAI

  Jai hands the phone off.

             So, what do you think?

                          ISABEL
             I think we could get 100 new beds for
             what they are paying for this hotel
             suite.

                          PREENA

       Theresa, Oscar, and Grace, all dressed in their wedding
       attire. They stand on a little brick patio in front of a
       small greenhouse; waiting. About 50 feet away, the guests
       are seated, waiting.

       Oscar and Theresa stand on either side of Grace. They
       look across at her, and then anxiously to each other.
       Grace looks straight ahead, avoiding their gaze. Theresa
       reaches up to Grace to fix a stray hair. Grace pulls away
       annoyed.

                                 GRACE
                  Please...

       Theresa nods. They settle back into waiting. After a
       moment:

                               OSCAR
                  You look beautiful, sweetheart.

       gather themselves, and begin walking.

       About 75 people. Everyone turns to see the bride and her
       parents as they walk up the isle.

       Jonathan smiles as he waits at the front, next to the
       Buddhist monk who will be preforming the ceremony.

       People take out their phones to take some pictures and
       videos.

       ON Grace, all smiles as she arrives next to Jonathan. Her
       parents kiss her, then take their seats.

       Looking between the Bride and Groom, we see the beautiful
       stone sculpture Oscar was finishing earlier. It’s an
       abstract depiction of 2 entwined bodies. Somewhere
       between Picasso and Giacometti.

       dresses. She anxiously tries to look past the traffic.

       out. One of the wedding staff points her toward the
       house.

       She kicks off her shoes and runs up toward the wedding.


70     EXT. HOUSE, BACK YARD, WEDDING AREA                         70

       The monk delivers the vows.

                               MONK
                  Remember to be patient with yourselves
                  and others, knowing that change comes
                  slowly and gradually. Seek inspiration
                  from your family and friends.

       Theresa and Oscar sit in the front, a mixture of nerves
       and excitement.

       An usher quietly shows Isabel to a seat in the back.

       A few people turn to look at her. She smiles
       uncomfortably and tries to focus on the ceremony.

                               MONK (CONT’D)
                  To make your relationship work will take
                  love. This is the core of your marriage
                  and why you are here, today.

       IN FRONT: Theresa puts her hand on Oscar’s leg. Oscar
       looks at Theresa and smiles.

       IN BACK: Isabel takes it all in. Gradually, her eyes fall
       on Oscar’s profile. She freezes.

                               MONK (CONT’D)
                  It will take trust, to know, that in your
                  hearts, you truly want what is best for
                  each other. It will take dedication, to
                  stay open to one another - and to learn
                  and grow together.

       Heart beating out of her chest, Isabel leans in subtly
       trying to see Oscar more clearly.

                               MONK (CONT’D)
                  It will take faith, to go forward
                  together, without knowing exactly what
                  the future brings. And it will take
                  commitment, to hold true to the journey
                  you both have pledged to today.

        Again on Oscar’s profile from Isabel’s perspective.

        Quick cut.

        Isabel quickly stands and heads in the back door of the
        house.


71      INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, FOYER/LIVING ROOM           71

        Isabel paces nervously in the front foyer.

        She catches herself in the reflection of the glass and
        tries to gather herself. She looks back outside through
        window where the bride is just kissing the groom. Guests
        stand and cheer. She sees Oscar as he cranes his head to
        look to where Isabel was sitting.


A72     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              A72

        Isabel walks in and takes in her surroundings. Beautiful,
        expensive art on the wall by the fireplace.

        A grand piano. A small metal sculpture by the window that
        looks like a man, looking out.

        Art books are laid out on the table. She goes over to
        one. It’s a catalogue from a show. She looks down at the
        cover.

        “Oscar Carlson, Sculpture 2003-2010”

        She leafs through a couple pages. Arrives at his picture
        in the front. He looks younger. She lingers on it for a
        moment. A staff member startles her.

                                  STAFF

72     EXT. SIDE PORCH AREA - MINUTES LATER                        72

       The guests mill about, celebrating. The twins chase each
       other around through the chairs and guests. On the bar
       are listed the specialty drinks “The Grace” and “The
       Jonathan”

       People congratulate the happy couple.

       Isabel steps out onto the back porch, but keeps her
       distance from the party. Everyone is in celebration mode.

       The photographer gathers the bride and the groom’s
       families together for a group shot.

       Isabel continues to watch from a distance. As the picture
       is being taken, Oscar’s gaze falls on Isabel standing in
       the background. Time seems to stop as they look at each
       other.

       Close on each of them staring across a sea of people.
       They seem to be the only two people there.

       Oscar excuses himself from the group and approaches
       Isabel.

       As he steps in near her, the electricity is palpable. He
       looks confused and isn’t sure what to say.

                          OSCAR
             What are you doing here?

  Isabel takes a deep breath.

  ON THERESA, as she spots Isabel talking to Oscar. Theresa
  excuses herself and heads over.

                          THERESA
             Isabel, I’m so glad you could make it.

  Isabel tries to mask her discomfort.

                          ISABEL
             Congratulations. It was a beautiful
             ceremony. What I saw, at least. There was
             an accident. And I was stuck in traffic.

                          THERESA
             Oh no. Well, you made it for the party.

  She studies Isabel for a moment.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Did you meet my husband?

  Isabel nods, awkwardly.

                          THERESA (CONT'D)
                   (to Oscar)
             Isabel runs an orphanage in India I may

  Oscar is reeling. He nods.                                        *

  Grace appears, glowing with nervous energy.

                          GRACE
             Mom, do you think I should change my
             dress before dinner?

                          THERESA
             Keep it on sweetheart. People love to see
             the bride in her dress.

  Grace is beaming. Her eyes fall on Isabel.

                          ISABEL
             It’s a beautiful dress.

                          GRACE
             Isn’t it? It’s my moms.

                            THERESA
             Yours now.

  Grace smiles. Oscar stands by in a stunned silence.
  Isabel gives a tense smile. Jonathan appears.

                          JONATHAN
             Baby, People are staring to sit down
             already, let’s head over.

  He sees Isabel.

                          JONATHAN (CONT’D)
             Oh hi. Glad you could make it.

                          GRACE
             You know each other?

                          JONATHAN
             I drove her to the office the other day
             to meet your mom.

  Some awkward smiles. The photographer comes over and
  pushes them all together.

             Let’s get a picture.

  Nothing to do but pose. Couldn’t be more awkward. The

       Beautifully decorated with flowers. Filled with guests
       and waiters buzzing about.

       Everyone enjoys themselves. Young and old.

       Close on the menu in the middle of a table: “Lobster
       Risotto”.

       Two long tables holding 40 each. Isabel is down in
       Siberia with a few of the more peripheral guests. Mostly
       older, except for one conservatively handsome man, FRANK
       (late 40’s) who sits next to her. She glances at him.
       Only a lone piece of meat sitting on his plate. At the
       front, Jonathan calls everyone to attention.

             I’m on this paleo thing. Training for a
             Tri. In Hawaii, on the big island.

  Isabel looks at him then back to the front where Jonathan
  calls everyone to attention.

                          JONATHAN
             Hi everyone. I want to welcome all of
             you.

  He takes a deep breath and looks at the big crowd.

                          JONATHAN (CONT’D)
             Wow. I thought the saying ‘I do’ part
             would be the hardest.

  People laugh. Grace rolls her eyes. Jonathan rubs her
  back. Theresa and Oscar smile at each other.

                          JONATHAN (CONT’D)
             Thank you for coming to celebrate with
             us.

  He takes a speech out of his pocket.

                          JONATHAN (CONT'D)
             When I started working for Theresa at
             ‘Horizon’, right out of school...

                          FRIEND
             You can say Harvard!

  They laugh. Grace shakes her head. Jonathan smiles and
  continues.

                          JONATHAN
             I thought I was just getting a great job
             for one of the most forward-thinking,
             entrepreneurs I had ever read about.

  Theresa smiles, a little uncomfortable.

                          JONATHAN (CONT'D)
             But very quickly I came to dread coming
             into work. It wasn’t my boss’ fault.
             Well, sort of it was. You see two years
             ago, Grace started coming in with
             Theresa. She was working in the design
             department for the summer.

  Grace shakes her head, embarrassed.

              She’s an amazing artist, for any of you
              who don’t know. Anyway, I saw them
              coming through the lobby; these two
              beautiful, powerful women. And I froze.
                    (to Grace and Theresa)
              In fact, there was room in your elevator,
              but I couldn’t bring myself to get in.

  People think it’s cute. An older women at Isabel’s table
  makes an aside to her friend.

                           OLDER WOMAN
                    (to her friend)
              Which one is he in love with?

                           JONATHAN
              Well, I spent the next month trying to
              find a way to be in the same place at the
              same time with Grace. And finally, I
              braved an elevator ride with her.

  Grace blushes.

                           JONATHAN (CONT’D)
              Do you remember my genius banter?

  She nods.

  Everyone laughs.

              I would plan things to say when I saw
              her, but they never came out. Until one
              day, I got lucky.

  People hoot.

                           JONATHAN (CONT’D)

                           JONATHAN (CONT’D)
              We were in the company pub, and she was
              on line right in front of me. And she had
              forgotten her wallet. So I paid. Best $14
              I ever spent.

             Grace, I love you more than anything. And
             I couldn’t be happier that you agreed to
             marry me. Even if it was out of guilt
             about owing me money.

  Grace stands and they kiss. Everyone claps. It goes on
  for a while and the crowd loves it.

  Theresa smiles at them and Oscar tries to, but it’s going
  on a while.

  At Isabel’s table, Frank leans in.

                          FRANK
             That’s going to be a fun honeymoon.

  The bride and groom pull apart. Grace remains standing
  and clinks her glass.

                          GRACE
             Hi, Hi. You’re not quite free yet!

  Grace’s hand shakes as she speaks. Oscar takes it.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             Sorry. Those of you who know me, know how
             much I love to speak in public.

  Some laughter. Isabel watches her. Grace gathers herself,
  fighting through her shyness.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             Jonathan, I love you. And I am so happy
             to be your wife.

             But this speech isn’t for you, it’s for
             Mom and Dad.

  She turns to her dad, whose hand she is still holding.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             Dad, I don’t know a girl who is closer
             with her father than I am with you. And I
             am so grateful for that.

             Not many fathers would have done what you
             did at such a young age.

             And thank you for your beautiful gift.

  She motions to the carved statue which has now been moved
  behind them in the tent. People oooh and ahh and clap.
  Oscar smiles and kisses her hand. He beams.

             I’m not sure if it’s me and Grace, or
             Grace and her dad!

  Some laugh awkwardly, but the joke doesn’t go over well
  with Oscar. Theresa makes eye contact with Oscar.

             I’m kidding, of course. We absolutely

  Theresa laughs and pushes away a tear.

               choose my own mother.

  Isabel sits up. Tension building in her.

                            GRACE (CONT’D)
               It was just me and dad for the first year
               of my life.

  Grace takes a moment.

                            GRACE (CONT'D)
               ... After my birth mother wasn’t well
               enough to care for me.

  On Isabel, frozen.

                            GRACE (CONT’D)
               And dad and I went everywhere together;
               me strapped to his chest.

  On the crowd in rapt attention.

                            GRACE (CONT’D)
               One day, we were walking down the street
               in Soho. And this beautiful woman, with
               shockingly red hair, had just moved to
               the neighborhood and was looking for a
               good place to have a coffee. I guess my
               dad and I looked like locals, so she came
               up, and asked if we knew of a place.

  She turns to her dad.

                            GRACE (CONT’D)
               And what did you say?

  He smiles.

                          OSCAR
             I said; “I don’t drink coffee, so I
             wouldn’t know”.

  Some laughter. Theresa remembers. Isabel is spinning.

                          GRACE
             And that would have been that, except, I
             had grabbed hold of her hair, and I
             wouldn’t let her go.

  Tears roll. Theresa and Grace hold hands.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             So my dad really had no choice but to
             start drinking coffee.

  People clap.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
                   (a long beat)
              I’m so happy I chose you.

  Everyone is near tears. Grace takes a deep breath.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             To my parents for giving me this
             wonderful life, and this beautiful night.
             And, oh yeah... to angelic brothers...

  The boys smile and play and pretend to fart in her
  direction.

                           GRACE (CONT’D)
             I love you.

  She raises a glass. The guests stand, clap, cheer. A
  guest yells out.

                   (Toasting)
             To Grace and Jonathan!

  We are with Isabel who is frozen in her seat. She stares
  off into the middle distance for a few moments.

                          FRANK
                   (encouraging her to get up)
             Hey, we’re toasting.

  She stands and heads out of the tent. Most of the guests
  are caught up in the toast and don’t notice, but Oscar
  does.

       On Isabel as she walks out of the tent.


75     EXT. BOAT DOCK   - DUSK                                    75

       Isabel sits by herself on a bench on a dock jutting out
       into the water, out of sight of the festivities.

       She tries to gather herself and put all this together.

       Suddenly up the dock walks Frank with two glasses and a
       bottle of champagne. She sees him and shakes her head to
       herself. He approaches.

                               FRANK
                  I couldn’t agree more. I’m not into
                  weddings.

       He sits next to her with the glasses and the bottle.

                               ISABEL
                  I’d like to be alone.

                               FRANK
                  Tell me about it. Crowds are awful.

       He pours her glass. She pushes it away. When he tries to
       hand it to her.

                               FRANK (CONT’D)
                  I can take one for the team and drink
                  them both.

       She can’t believe any of this is happening.

                               FRANK (CONT’D)
                  You know how at every wedding there are
                  always a few single people pretending not
                  to care that they’re single? Well, we’re
                  those people. Weird, huh? I’m divorced.
                  What’s your story?

                               ISABEL
                  My story is; I’d like to be alone.

                               FRANK
                        (trying to be charming)
                  You think you want to be alone...

                               ISABEL
                  Get the fuck away from me.

       She gets up and walks away.

                                FRANK
                  Okay...


76     EXT. TENT AREA - NIGHT                                      76

       Isabel approaches the tent purposefully.

       Inside, all the guests mill about, some dancing. Jonathan
       spins Grace.

       Theresa and Oscar watch happily.

       Outside, Isabel hangs in the shadows, watching.

       CLOSE ON GRACE as ISABEL WATCHES HER, STUDYING HER FACE.

       Oscar’s vision is drawn to Isabel. She looks back at him.

       Between the two of them, Grace and Jonathan dance.

       Isabel steps closer, staring intently at Oscar.

       After another moment, Oscar breaks away from the crowd
       and heads toward Isabel.


77     EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS                                 77

       Oscar walks by Isabel, who follows him away from the
       entrance and the party guests inside.

       They stand and face each other.

                               ISABEL
                  What did you do?

       Oscar looks at her.

                               OSCAR
                  What are you talking about?

                               ISABEL
                  Don’t. Too much adds up.

       Oscar looks behind him at the tent then back to Isabel.

                               ISABEL (CONT’D)
                  But then I think, you wouldn’t have done
                  that.
     Pink Rev. (05/28/18)            BF7                           49.


       He looks nervously behind him at the tent where people
       are starting to head out onto the lawn. Oscar doesn’t
       know what to say.

                               ISABEL (CONT’D)
                  I can see it.

       All Oscar can do is look away and shake his head. We
       don’t know if it means ‘no’, or ‘I can’t believe this’.
       He looks right up at her.


                               OSCAR
                  Isabel. We can’t talk about this now.

       A party worker opens the tent and makes an announcement.

                               PARTY WORKER
                  Fireworks are starting! Follow the
                  lanterns...

       Party workers stand outside in a line ready to hand out
       sparklers and drinks to people as they exit the tent. The
       guests whoop it up on the way out of the tent to the
       beach for the fireworks.

       Oscar looks from them to Isabel.

                               OSCAR
                  I have to go. I’ll call you tomorrow.

       Oscar backs away, then moves to join Theresa, Grace, and
       the others who pour out of the tent.

       Isabel watches, in shock.


78     EXT. DRIVEWAY OF HOUSE -    MINUTES LATER                   78

       Isabel walks away from the party down the big lawn,
       toward the driveway where the cars are lined.

       Behind her, a huge bang, and the sky is lit up by the
       first of the fireworks.


79     EXT. BACK LAWN, OVER LOOKING WATER - NIGHT                  79

       The crowd ooh’s and ahh’s at the fireworks display.

       We find Grace and Jonathan standing next to Theresa and
       Oscar, their faces illuminated by the different color
       fireworks.


80     EXT. GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY - NIGHT                          80

       Isabel rides in the back, alternating between
       illumination and darkness as the car passes through the
       parkway lights.


81     EXT. WEDDING AREA, LATE NIGHT                               81

       Everyone is pretty loose. Theresa dances with Oscar.
       Drunk and happy.


82     INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S BATHROOM - 3AM                     82

       Theresa finishes washing her face, then takes a pill.


83     INT. THERESA’S AND OSCAR’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS             83

       Theresa walks into the dark bedroom turning the light off
       behind her. Oscar is in bed. She climbs in next to him.

                               THERESA
                  I think people seemed to have a good
                  time, don’t you think?

       Oscar looks at her through the darkness. A long moment.

                               OSCAR
                  Why’d you do it?

       Theresa gets close and lays on his chest.

                               THERESA
                        (quietly)
                  God, I didn’t know. I didn’t know it was
                  her.

       Oscar looks back at her, dubiously.


84     INT./EXT. BOWERY HOTEL PENTHOUSE - MORNING                  84

       Isabel sits out on the balcony wrapped in a blanket,
       phone in her lap. She hasn’t slept.

       The phone rings and she runs in to pick it up.

                  Hello...

       Her face falls with disappointment. We can just hear the
       voice leaking through the phone.

                               HOUSEKEEPING (O.C.)
                  Hi Ms. Andersen. We are calling to check
                  to see if you need more towels, or new
                  linens?

                                 ISABEL
                  No.

       She hangs up. Waits a moment thinking, then stands.

       Isabel waits while a bellman hails a taxi.


86     INT. TAXI, GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY - DAY                     86

       Isabel sits in the back staring out the window.

       Her Indian driver is on the phone with a headset in. He
       speaks to the person on the line in Bengali.

                  to have sex all night. Late 30’s? Who
                  knows? I can’t tell the difference with
                  white girls.

       On Isabel. He looks in the mirror.

                  No, I prefer it quiet.

       The driver’s eyes widen as he realizes she can speak his
       language.

       Jonathan unwraps a present. It’s a table cloth. Has a
       pattern.

       He and Grace unfurl it.

                               JONATHAN
                  It’s a blanket...?

                  Maybe it’s a cape.

       Oscar looks closely.

                               OSCAR
                  I think it might be the confederate flag.

       They laugh. Theresa looks at the card.

                               THERESA
                  I think it’s one of our lawyers...

       Theresa opens the door. It’s Isabel.

       They look at each other for a long moment.

                  Come in.

       Isabel enters.

             Oh hi.

  Isabel has stepped into the doorway of the living room.
  Theresa and Oscar don’t quite know what to do.

                          GRACE (CONT'D)
              Isabel, right?

  Isabel uncomfortably nods.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             Thanks for coming yesterday.

  Isabel is taken with her.

                   (awkwardly)
             Of course. Thank you for having me.

  Oscar stands.

                          OSCAR
             I was going to call you.

                          ISABEL
             But you didn’t.

  There’s obvious tension. Grace and Jonathan sense it.

                          THERESA
             Would you like something to drink?

                         ISABEL

  Theresa and Oscar look at each other.

                          THERESA
             Why don’t we show you around?

  She nods and they begin to head out of the room. The air
  is heavy.

                          JONATHAN
             Is everything okay?

                          THERESA
             It’s fine. But, keep opening. Otherwise
             we will be here till next week.

       Oscar walks in followed by Isabel, then Theresa. Theresa
       closes the door and makes sure it’s shut.

       Isabel and Oscar look at each other. So much weight
       between them.

                               OSCAR
                  What do you want?

       She lets out a shocked laugh.

                        (choking up)
                  I want to know why my daughter is in the
                  other room.

       He looks at her with a mixture of fear and contempt, then
       turns away.

                               ISABEL (CONT’D)

                  A lot more easily than if I had left her

                  How did it even happen? We decided we
                  couldn’t keep a baby.

                               OSCAR
                  No, you decided.

                  adoption. Because we decided that was
                  best for her.

  A long moment where no one knows what to say. Theresa
  tries to calm things.

                          THERESA
             Isabel, we tried to find you.

                          ISABEL
             You have all the money in the world, you
             could have sent an army looking for me.
             You didn’t want to find me. You liked
             being the hero.

                          OCSAR
             Don’t you talk to her like that! You
             didn’t want to be found. You ran the
             second they let you out of the hospital.

                          ISABEL
             You’re god damn right I did! You know how
             painful that decision was to make. You
             were there.

                          OSCAR
             I don’t remember it being hard for you at
             all. And if it was, you didn’t tell me.
             You just shut down. You were a fucking
             zombie.

                          ISABEL
             So that gave you the right to take her
             and raise her behind my back... Because I
             was conflicted about being a mother when
             I was 18?

                          OSCAR
             Conflicted? You were fucking crazy! One
             second telling me we were going to have
             some great life, the next that you were
             going to kill yourself.

                          ISABEL
                   (screaming)
             I never said that.

                          OSCAR
             Yes you did! YOU DID!

  They are screaming. Theresa steps in.

                          ISABEL
             Why didn’t you just tell me you were
             going to keep her?

  Oscar takes a moment and composes himself.

                          OSCAR
             I didn’t know until you left. And by then
             I couldn’t find you.

  He shakes his head.

                          OSCAR (CONT’D)
             I’m not going to justify it to you. I
             don’t owe you anything.

  She can’t believe this.

                          ISABEL
             Owe? Isn’t this your daughter we’re
             talking about? Doesn’t she deserve to
             know her mother?

  Oscar is shaking his head.

                          OSCAR
             You chose that. Not me.

  Isabel looks at him nakedly.

                          ISABEL
             Where did she think I was?

  Oscar stares back.

                          OCSAR
             You can’t suddenly just show up...

  She takes a deep breath.

                          ISABEL
             What do you expect me to do now? Turn my
             back?

  Oscar looks at her, as if to say ‘if the shoe fits’.

       Grace and Jonathan have been opening gifts with the
       twins, and haven’t heard the yelling.

       They watch as Isabel opens the front door and exits
       without a look or a good-bye.

       Jonathan and Grace look at each other, sensing
       something’s off. Jonathan goes to the window and peers
       out.

       tries to hold her hand. She pulls it away.

       She looks to Theresa to see if it’s true. Theresa’s face

       The doors are open.

       Oscar sits alone smoking a cigarette, as he stares back
       at the house. A few rooms illuminated.

       On a work table sits a pile of old drawings. Seems to be
       an series of charcoal lines intertwining. All the
       sketches have the same theme, though the specifics and
       materials used vary.

       Feet intertwined on a beach. Reflected flicker of a camp
       fire.

       After another moment, Oscar puts out the cigarette,
       reaches down and pulls the extension cord apart. The barn
       goes dark.

                  know the woman who gave birth to me?

             You’re fucking right! I don’t understand.

  Grace looks at him, still angry.

             I didn’t want you to know that she gave
             you up. So I told you she had died. Can

             I could call... Now, that I know you
             exist.

  They share a smile.

                          ISABEL
             Or I could call you. If you want.

  The interaction is awkward, but sweet.

                          GRACE
             Okay, yes. Great. Let me give you my
             number.

  Isabel stands looking at her daughter.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             Do you have a phone?

  Isabel gets her cell phone and hands it to Grace. Grace
  puts in her number. As she does, Isabel takes the
  opportunity to really look at her.

  She hands Isabel her cell phone. They stand, facing each
  other.

                   I should go. Jonathan is waiting for me.

        Isabel nods. After another moment, they embrace.

        Isabel walks Grace to the door. She opens it. Grace walks
        out with a little wave. Isabel closes the door.


104     INT. BOWERY HOTEL HALLWAY, OUTSIDE ISABEL’S ROOM           104

        Grace walks away from Isabel’s room, a growing sense of
        wonder on her face.

        Isabel says a special good-bye to Jai. He kneels.

                                ISABEL
                   I want you to help teach the meditation
                   class while I’m away. You need to show
                   the others how it’s done.

        He looks unsure. She takes him in.

                                ISABEL (CONT’D)
                   Close your eyes.

        She waits. He doesn’t close them.

        Isabel takes her hand and closes Jai’s eyes, then closes
        her own.

                                ISABEL (CONT’D)
                   They are not closed. They are looking
                   inside you. And only you get to see that.

                                JAI
                   I see darkness.

                                ISABEL
                   No, really look. And you can see all the
                   people you love, everything your
                   imagination can create. And you hear

107     INT. ROSE OF INDIA RESTAUTANT, 6TH ST - NIGHT              107

        The place is entirely red, with Christmas lights lining
        every square inch.

        Loud Indian music plays. Four waiters are gathered around
        a table in the back, singing an Indian version of happy
        birthday as they clap.

        Isabel and Grace sit at a table near the front, watching
        the celebration. It finishes and the lights go back on.

                                GRACE
                   I thought it might remind you of home.
                         (embarrassed)
                   It was probably stupid.

                                ISABEL
                   No, it was thoughtful.

        They smile at each other.

                                GRACE
                   Jonathan took me here on one of our first
                   dates. It seemed exotic then.

                                ISABEL
                   You two seem happy together.

        Grace nods.

                   To tell you the truth, it’s kind of hard

             I get it.

  The waiter refills their glasses.

                          GRACE
             Do I have any brothers or sisters I don’t
             know about?

  Isabel is taken by surprise by the question.

                          ISABEL
             No. I mean, not exactly.

  Grace is unsure what she means.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             There is one boy at the orphanage who
             I’ve pretty much raised. We found him on
             the road when he was just 1. Abandoned.

                          GRACE
             How old is he now?

                          ISABEL
             8 next week. Jai.

                         GRACE
             “Jai’.

  Isabel nods.

                          ISABEL
             He loves birds. And he wants to be a
             professional football player.

                          GRACE
             Soccer you mean?

  Isabel smiles and nods. Grace looks at her for a long
  moment, then reaches into her bag and pulls out a leather
  bound picture album.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             I brought some pictures. If you want to
             see?

                          ISABEL
             I would love that.

  Grace opens the book, revealing a picture of her as a 5-
  year-old in the bath.

  Isabel looks closely. Studies it. Grace turns the page.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             This was second grade.

                          ISABEL
             And who’s that?

  She points to a little boy.

                            GRACE
             That’s Lyle.

                          ISABEL
             Was he your boyfriend?

                          GRACE
             For a minute. But he dumped me when I got
             him out in dodgeball.

  Isabel smiles.

                          ISABEL
             Better off. No one likes a sore loser...

  Grace laughs and turns the page.

  A picture of Grace with Theresa. Looks like a first day
  of school.

  Another of Grace sitting behind Theresa’s desk,
  pretending to be the boss. Isabel takes them in.

  A family shot with Oscar.

  Grace on the couch holding both her newborn brothers.

  Grace and Oscar holding surf boards on a beach when she
  was about 15. Snap shots of a whole life. Isabel takes it
  all in.

             Dad said you were depressed.

  Isabel moves her head back and forth, considering.

                   Probably. We were really young.

        Grace thinks.

                                GRACE
                   I don’t think I could give up a baby.

                   But I knew I couldn’t take care of you.

        Grace tries to understand.

                   The best I could do was to bring you into

        Pretty desolate. Isabel and Grace have been walking for a
        while. Grace is behind Isabel looking at a tattoo she has
        on her shoulder. It’s the earth, a globe. Grace is
        fascinated.

                                ISABEL
                   I drew it myself and had them copy it.

             I’m sure that would make your mother

  The air gets thick for a second.

             We heard you made out pretty well.

                          THERESA
             Is that a surprise? Now, I’m just a very
             rich employee.

  They smile at her.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             This is my friend, Isabel. Richard -
             Eddie.

  The men smile at Isabel.

                          THERESA (CONT'D)
             I’m about to donate a small fortune to
             the orphanage she runs in India.

  Isabel is taken by surprise by this information.

                          THERESA
             It’s about time.

  They all laugh and the men leave. The martini arrives,
  Theresa starts on it.

                          ISABEL
             I assumed after the other night...

                          THERESA
             Why? It makes more sense now. We’re
             practically family.

  Isabel looks at Theresa, trying to read her. The waiter
  approaches.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
                   (to the waiter)
             The sole. For both of us.

  He nods and scurries off.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             You’ll love it.

  Isabel narrows in on Theresa.

                          ISABEL
             Why are you doing this?

  Theresa smiles.

                          THERESA
             Just be grateful and try not to ruin it.             *

             The only thing you need to know is what
             you can do with the money.

  Isabel’s mind is spinning.

             It’s a good day for both of us.

  Theresa finishes her second martini. She looks at Isabel.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             It must have been strange seeing Oscar
             again.

  Isabel nods, tentatively.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Does he look different?

                          ISABEL
             I don’t remember.

                          THERESA
             Oh gimme a break. I mean, he is handsome
             now, but back then...

                          ISABEL
             You knew who I was when you invited me
             here, didn’t you?

                          THERESA
             No. I did not. All I knew was what my
             people told me; That there was a good
             charitable opportunity. The rest is fate.

                          ISABEL
             I don’t believe you.

                          THERESA
             Well, That doesn’t matter.

                          ISABEL
             What do you want?

                          THERESA
             The real answer?

                         ISABEL
             Yes.

                          THERESA
             I want to make money.

  Theresa smiles. Isabel looks at her dubiously.

             Grace said you two had dinner.

  Isabel nods.

             Good. I’m glad you’re spending time
             together.

  Gwen, Theresa’s assistant, appears at the table.

  Gwen swallows hard.

                          GWEN
             You have a conference call. I was trying
             to text you but you weren’t picking up.

                          THERESA
             Who scheduled a call during lunch?

                          GWEN

             Well, I’m not available to talk right
             now, so push the call.

  Gwen stands there.

                          GWEN
             You specially asked me to schedule it
             before London closed.

  Theresa raises her voice.

                          THERESA
                   (loudly)
             Jesus Christ! Do I work for you or do you

  People turn and look. Gwen is frozen. Isabel sits
  uncomfortably.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Which one is it?!

                          GWEN
             I work for you.

                          THERESA
             Very good. That’s using your brain. Now
             go push the fucking call and if you can’t
             then don’t come in tomorrow.

114     EXT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - EVENING       114

        Theresa sits staring out into the darkness with a mostly
        finished drink in front of her.

        Oscar walks out carrying a few folders.

                               OSCAR
                   Hey.

        She doesn’t move. He puts the folders down in front of
        her.

                                OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   The office dropped these off.

        She looks at him with a dark expression. He examines her.

                                OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   They also wanted to know if you were
                   okay.

                                THERESA
                         (drunk)
                   I decided to go ahead and finance
                   Isabel’s orphanage.

        Oscar isn’t sure what to say.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   Are you going to say anything?

                                OSCAR
                   I’m sure she’s happy about that.

        She laughs.

                                THERESA
                   You two are perfect for each other.

        He’s totally taken aback.

                                OSCAR
                   What the hell does that mean?

                                THERESA
                   It means she didn’t seem that grateful

                   No responsibility that way.

        Oscar looks at her and shakes his head. She stands.

                                OSCAR
                   You think you’re the only one affected by
                   this?

        He tries to make eye contact with her but she seems far
        off. She moves to leave, and he grabs her arm. They look
        at each other.

                                OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   Don’t go up to the boys room like this.

        She blows up.

                                THERESA
                   Don’t tell me what to do. Don’t tell me
                   how to be a mother! It’s not like you’re

                   sick of hearing that single dad story.

                   It’s going to require you stay a few more
                   days while we get the details worked out.

                   I know, I understand. But I the
                   circumstances have changed. You’ve
                   convinced me that this is too important
                   to just be a one off donation. And, it
                   means a lot to me that you're Grace’s

                                OSCAR
                   Sounds familiar.

                                THERESA
                   See, I’m listening; even when you think
                   I’m not.

                                OSCAR
                   Say hi to your sister. And please be
                   careful.

        She waves to him and starts the car. She turns the radio
        on and music blares.

                                OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   I could come...

        She turns it up very loud and makes a motion like she
        can’t hear him. He backs off. She pulls away.

        The news plays on the radio.

        Oscar makes a sandwich.

        The doorbell rings. He looks up, not expecting anyone.

        Oscar opens the door to reveal Isabel. He’s surprised.

             With Grace. We’d run it together.

  Oscar looks surprised.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             I don’t know if Grace even knows. Or if
             any of it’s even real. Frankly, I don’t
             really trust your wife.

                          OSCAR
             You don’t trust her? She offers you money
             to run a charity and you question her
             integrity?

             Is it real?

             You don’t need to be poor to have good
             intentions. There are people with money
             and ideals.

                          ISABEL
             Oh really? That’s not what I remember you
             saying when I knew you.

                          OSCAR

             You think you’re in charge of her?

  He stays still.

             I hate to tell you, but she’ll do
             whatever she wants. We all do eventually.

  The depth of the truth in that statement lies there
  between them.

  Oscar goes to the window and looks out. Isabel watches
  him.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             Theresa doesn’t care about the orphanage.
             She barely wanted to hear about it. She
             cares about business. So what does she
             want?

  Oscar thinks.

                          OSCAR
             Maybe to give Grace some direction?

  He softens.

             Seems to be a theme for me these days.

  Isabel nods.

  She sits opposite him. They aren’t sure where to go.

             I looked up some of your work online.

  He looks at her.

        sculptures, the new unfinished work.

        Oscar and Isabel wander around the massive stone he is
        getting ready to work on.

130     INT. OSCAR’S STUDIO - LATE MORNING                      130

        Some workers are preparing the big stone for cutting.

        Grace appears at the door.

                                GRACE
                   Is my father here?

                                WORKER
                   He took a break.


131     EXT. TRAIL THROUGH THE WOODS - DAY                      131

        Oscar walks through the woods, looking at the light as it
        cuts through the trees. He checks a little compass app.
        on his phone that tracks the sun.

        Behind him, Grace calls.

                                 GRACE
                   Dad!

        He turns, she catches up to him.

                                GRACE (CONT'D)
                   What are you doing out here?

        Oscar takes her in.

                                OSCAR
                   Gracie... I’m just... thinking.

        He looks weighed upon.

                          GRACE
             I hate fighting with you.

                          OSCAR
             You think you’ll forgive me?

  She looks at him and shakes her head.

                          GRACE
             What’s my other option?

  He’s relieved.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             But I want to know everything.

  Oscar nods, takes her hand.

                          OSCAR
             Of course, Bunny.                                 *

                          GRACE
             Don’t call me that.

                          OSCAR
             OK. What should I call you?

                          GRACE
             How about my name.

  He nods slowly and looks at her. Takes a moment.

                          OSCAR
             When you give a child up for adoption,
             you have a period of time to change your
             mind. 30 days. A “grace” period.

  She listens intently. Thinks.

                          GRACE
             So, how long did it take for you to
             decide to come get me?

                          OSCAR
             29 days. Visiting every day.

  Grace listens intently.

                          OSCAR (CONT’D)
             We had agreed once you were born we would
             both leave. She kept up her end of the
             bargain.

  Oscar remembers.

                          OSCAR (CONT’D)
             And I meant to. But I thought; ‘I’ll just
             go see her for an hour.’ Then I couldn’t
             stop going. Staring at you, talking to
             you.

  Grace digests all this.

                          GRACE
             And they don’t have to contact the mom?

                          OSCAR
             A “Good faith effort”, they call it.
             Just sending a letter to the last known
             address. But she didn’t even have one and
             I knew they wouldn’t find her.

  She looks at her dad, pained and relived to be hearing
  the real story.

                          GRACE
             Did you marry mom for my sake? So I would
             have a mother?

  A moment before he answers.

                          OSCAR
             I knew she’d be a great mother; but I
             married her because I love her.

                            GRACE
             Do you?

  Oscar looks at her for a long moment.

                            OSCAR
             Yes.

                          GRACE
             So, Isabel was just a mistake?

  She’s really grilling him.

                          OSCAR
             No, not a mistake. We were just... young.           *

  He looks off.

                          GRACE
             Then why didn’t you tell me about her?

  Oscar thinks.

                                OSCAR
                   I wanted to forget.

                                 GRACE
                   Did you?

        Oscar thinks.

                                 OSCAR
                   No.

        He looks off.


132     INT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON                                    132

        Oscar walks up the stairs, holding the reconstructed
        bird’s nest.


133     INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S BEDROOM                          133

        Oscar walks through to her closet.


134     INT. THERESA’ CLOSET - MINUTES LATER                      134

        Oscar stands on a stool trying to rig the birds nest so
        it can hang from the ceiling, suspended by an eye hook
        and monofilament.

        He gets it rigged. There is some excess monofilament at
        from where he’s tied it off and he tries to break it with
        his teeth. It won’t break.

        He gets down off the step ladder and looks around for a
        scissors. Opens a couple drawers.

        Approaches Theresa’s make-up table.

        He opens one drawer, then another. No scissors, but
        something catches his eye:

        A weekly pill sorter with unidentifiable pills in it,
        sorted by day. He lifts it. Underneath is a locked box.

        He rattles the top. It won’t open.

        He opens the other drawers, looking more and more
        urgently for the key. Finally, he takes the middle drawer
        completely out and rifles through her things. There is a
        small cup filled with coins. He dumps it out, and amongst
        the coins finds a little key. He reaches for it.

        On Oscar as he slips the key in the lock box. It fits. He
        turns it and the top opens. The box is filled with
        prescription drug bottles. Oscar reads the prescriptions:
        Kepra, Oxycodone, Prednisone. He is confused.


135     INT. THERESA’S CAR - AFTERNOON                             135

        Theresa pulls into the driveway with the kids. They all
        are singing to the radio.


136     EXT. DRIVEWAY OF HOUSE - DAY                               136

        Theresa helps the boys out of the car. They each carry a
        huge stuffed animal.

        Oscar comes out to greet them.

                                THERESA
                   Go show daddy. And tell him we won them.

        Otto and Theo run to Oscar.

                                THEO
                   Daddy, look what we won!

        They hold out their animals.

                                OSCAR
                   Wow, those are huge! How did you win
                   them?

        The boys don’t have an answer. The both look back to
        their mom, who is taking her bag out of the car.

                                THERESA
                   We stopped at a lovely go-kart track off
                   the highway that had a few carnival
                   games.

                                OTTO
                   And mom said the games were a waste of
                   time so she bought them for us.

        She’s caught. Gives Oscar a funny smile.

                                THERESA
                   It really smelled like feet and hot dogs
                   in there, and I wanted to beat the
                   traffic.

                   to get to the office.

        Oscar looks at her searchingly as he takes her bag. She
        senses something but turns away.

                   Boys, go in with daddy and take a bath.

        They run toward the house. Theresa heads back to the car.

                   I should be back for dinner.

                   I spoke to your doctor.

        She freezes for a moment.

                   You’ve known for 3 months?

        and opens the door.

                   What? He spoke to you? Our relationship
                   is confidential. He’s not allowed to tell
                   you anything. I could sue him!

             No. I’m not getting out. I’m your
             husband. I’m never getting out.

  Takes a long moment.

        the passenger side door open.

        We stay in the car with her as she leans over to try and

        Isabel stands in a little makeshift stall at the market
        being fit for the dress she wore to Theresa’s office the

        On the other end, Preena holds the phone out the window
        of her office toward the courtyard where Jai’s party is
        going on. The group sings happy birthday.

        On her end, Isabel listens intently, and mouths a few of
        the words.

        They finish and people cheer. Jai looks up to the window
        and sees Preena with the phone.

        her.                                                              *

                          ISABEL
             There are a couple of points I don’t
             understand.

  Theresa looks over her shoulder.

                          THERESA
             Oh, that just means if you and Grace
             can’t agree on how the funds are
             distributed, Oscar will be the tie
             breaking vote. I thought it would be
             better if it wasn’t me.

  She smiles and sits.

                          ISABEL
             Not that.
                   (pointing)
             This.

  Theresa reads.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             It says I have to ‘reside’ in New York?

  Theresa nods.

                          THERESA
             Yes. Your cost of living will be taken          *
             care of.

  Isabel is baffled.

                          ISABEL
             I can just come for board meetings, do
             the rest over Skype.

  Theresa looks at Isabel impassively.

                          THERESA
             I’m afraid it’s a requirement.

  This rubs Isabel the wrong way.

                          ISABEL
             That makes no sense. Why?

                          THERESA
                   (deep breath)
             I know you are used to running things at
             the Orphanage, but you aren’t familiar
             with what it takes to manage millions of
             dollars. So I would like you here.                *

  Isabel shakes her head and thinks.

                          ISABEL
             6 months here and 6 there.

  Theresa looks at her dead on.

                          THERESA
             It’s non-negotiable.

  Isabel struggles to understand.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             And please don’t waste our time
             pretending you aren’t going to do it.             *

  Isabel begins to let her anger out.

                          ISABEL
             You think I give a shit about your money?         *

                         THERESA                               *
             I do.                                             *

                          ISABEL                               *
             You think I’m for sale? You can’t buy me.         *

  Isabel gets up.                                              *

                          THERESA
             I don’t want to buy you. This is an               *
             opportunity.                                      *

  Isabel becomes more and more agitated, like a caged
  animal.

                          ISABEL
                   (yelling)

  She pushes the contract off the table and some papers
  fly. Theresa stays calm.

                          THERESA
             Call it whatever you want. But think what
             you could do with the money; how many
             kids you could help.

  She narrows in on Isabel.

                          THERESA (CONT'D)
             I know you’d sell yourself for that.

                          ISABEL
             Fuck you, you don’t know me.

  Isabel turns to walk out.

                          THERESA
             Actually I know all about you. 39 years
             old. Born in Troy, New York; raised by
             adoptive parents in Connecticut. Went to
             boarding school upstate, then Syracuse

             just like Grace.

  Isabel is reeling. She shakes her head.

                          ISABEL
             I have a life!                                         *

                          THERESA
             Your life will be good here.

                          ISABEL
             You think because your rich I’m going to               *

             fucking asshole?                                       *

  Theresa loses her temper.

                          THERESA
             You think that because you’re a do-gooder
             it makes up for the fact that you
             abandoned your child?

  It’s a gut punch. The two women stand facing each other,
  nakedly.

  Then Isabel turns, and walks out.

        Theresa watches her go, then closes her eyes and breathes
        in deeply.


141     INT. HORIZON STAIRWELL                                  141

        Isabel runs down the stairs, feet flying.


142     EXT. HUDSON STREET - MINUTES LATER                      142

        Isabel walks away from the office building, clearly
        upset.

        Theresa appears and calls to her.

                                 THERESA
                   Isabel!

        Isabel doesn’t stop. Theresa runs to catch up.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   Isabel. Stop. Come back. I’m sorry.

        Isabel turns to her, furious and wounded.

                                ISABEL
                   You are cruel! You think you’re so                  *
                   important. You sell... nothing. And the             *
                   world decided that’s worth a lot!                   *

        Theresa takes a deep breath.

                                THERESA
                   Listen to me. Listen. She’s our daughter.
                   We share her. I’ve had her for the last
                   20 years, and now she needs you.

        Theresa’s emotions begin to take over. Isabel is
        confused.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   And Oscar needs you...

        Theresa starts to cry. Isabel can’t handle it all.

                                ISABEL
                   You’re crazy.

                                 THERESA

                   I’m dying.

        Isabel is knocked back by the information, the emotion of
        Theresa, and what it all means.

        Isabel looks at her confused.

        Not knowing what to do, Isabel backs up, then turns and
        walks away from Theresa.


143     INT. BOWERY HOTEL - EVENING                                143

        Isabel stands looking out the window, trying to process
        it all. Some images of India. Of Oscar. Of Grace.

        The phone rings breaking her out of her reverie. She goes
        to answer. As she moves, she reveals her packed bags
        behind her.

        A KNOCK.

                                ISABEL
                   I’ll be right down.

        A knock again. Annoyed, she goes to the door and opens
        it. Grace stands in front of her, looking vulnerable and
        upset.

                   Yes, Of course. What is it?

        Grace walks in and looks at Isabel, face crumpling.

                   I don’t think I want to be married

        They sit on the bed facing each other.

                                GRACE
                   He says I’ve changed. That I don’t talk

                   His friends really.

        Isabel listens patiently. Grace looks far off.

                   And he’s a good person, but I look at him
                   now... and... He doesn’t want to know

                                ISABEL
                   Have you told your parents how you feel?

        She shakes her head ‘no’.

                                GRACE
                   I can’t. They thought I was too young to
                   get married. And they were right.

                   I wish I wasn’t married.

        say.

             Tell me what to do?

  Grace looks up at Isabel searchingly.

                          ISABEL
             Grace, I can’t do that.

                          GRACE

             Like you did?

  Isabel looks at Grace.

  They are entering tricky territory.

  Isabel looks at her.

  Grace’s anger and emotion rises.

        Isabel sits with a cup of coffee, waiting. Oscar enters
        and finds her. He walks to her table and sits. He looks
        exhausted.

                                  OSCAR
                   Is she okay?

        Isabel nods.

                                ISABEL
                   She’s confused and upset. She thinks she
                   made a mistake.

        Oscar isn’t clear.

                                ISABEL (CONT’D)
                   Apparently, she doesn’t love him.

        He nods. Half satisfied half worried.

                                OSCAR
                   And she came to you?

        Isabel nods with a little shrug.

                                OSCAR (CONT'D)
                   What did you tell her?

                                ISABEL
                   I told her... that it was her life.

        Oscar takes this in. He takes a deep breath.
Pink Rev. (05/28/18)              BF7                       107.


                          OSCAR
             Thank you for letting her stay.

  Grace walks in, surprising them. Oscar stands.

                          OSCAR (CONT’D)
             Hey, there you are.

  She is sheepishly emotional when she sees her dad. They
  look at each other at her for a moment, then he hugs her.

                          GRACE
             Do you hate me?

                          OSCAR
             Are you kidding?

  Isabel watches the embrace. They part and sit. Isabel
  smiles at her. Grace wipes a tear away. The three sit
  together. Odd.

  After a moment Grace reaches over and takes a sip of
  Isabel’s coffee.

                          ISABEL
             Sure, have some.

  Grace laughs while drinking.

                          GRACE
             I’ll get some more.

  She stands up.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             Do you want some, Dad?

  He nods.

                          ISABEL
             And see if they have any pastries.

  Graces walks into the main lobby toward the restaurant.

                          OSCAR
             She’s so sensitive.

                          ISABEL
             Where could she have gotten it?

  He smiles. Then uncomfortable with the situation, he rubs
  his face.

                                OSCAR
                   I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night.

        Isabel takes his hand.

                                ISABEL
                   Oscar. You have to tell her about
                   Theresa.

        This catches Oscar off guard, and he fights back some
        emotion. A long moment.

                                OSCAR
                   She made me promise I wouldn’t.

                                ISABEL
                   It doesn’t matter. She has to know.

        Oscar bows his head, trying to keep it together. Isabel
        takes his hand.

                                OSCAR
                         (struggling)
                   I don’t want to hurt her.

                                 ISABEL
                   Who?

        Grace arrives balancing 3 cups of coffee.

                                GRACE
                   They said they’d bring the pastries over.

        They all sit again. Grace starts to get upset.

                                GRACE (CONT’D)
                   Oh, I forgot the milk...

        He face crumples.

                                OSCAR
                   It’s okay, baby.

        Oscar reaches out for her and Isabel puts her hands on
        Grace’s arm.


148     INT. HORIZON OFFICES/ THERESA’S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY     148

        Isabel sits around a table opposite Theresa, Bill and a
        few other lawyers.

        A lawyer prepares the proper page. He passes it to
        Isabel.
Pink Rev. (05/28/18)            BF7                        109.


                          LAWYER
             Sign here.

  Isabel takes the paper and signs.

                          LAWYER (CONT’D)
             Theresa. Your turn.

  They pass the paper to Theresa who puts on her reading
  glasses. She begins to sign but the pen doesn’t work.
  Theresa shakes it, still doesn’t work. Immediately,
  everyone else in the room offers her their pen.

  She takes one and signs. Looks up with a smile.

                          THERESA
              It’s official. I have a lot less money.

  Everyone laughs.

                          ISABEL
             You’re changing a lot of peoples lives.

  Isabel looks at her with some hidden melancholy. There is
  an unintended double-meaning.

                          THERESA
             I hope you can do everything you want
             with it.

  Theresa’ assistant Gwen opens the door.

                          GWEN
             Sorry to interrupt, but Grace is here.

  Theresa looks confused and slightly flustered. Isabel
  gets her stuff together.

                          THERESA
             Oh.
                   (takes a moment)
             I wasn’t expecting her.

  Theresa’s gaze falls on Isabel.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Bring her in.

  Isabel stands, ready to go.

                          ISABEL
                   (to the lawyers)
             Thank you all for your time.
      Pink Rev. (05/28/18)           BF7                           110.


        She approaches Theresa, who looks at her curiously.

                                THERESA
                   Why don’t you stay?

                                ISABEL
                   I don’t think she came to see me.

        Isabel looks deeply at Theresa. Isabel puts out her hand.
        Slowly, Theresa shakes it. Isabel smiles, then is off.
        Theresa takes a deep breath.


149     INT. HORIZON, HALLWAY OUTSIDE THERESA’S CONFERENCE ROOM -149
        CONTINUOUS

        Isabel walks away from the conference room as Grace is
        walking in.

        They stop briefly.

                                ISABEL
                         (quietly)
                   You okay?

        Grace nods, subdued but determined. They grasp hands for
        a moment before continuing by each other.


150     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM                                       150

        Theresa stands as the Lawyers and Board Members are
        exiting. Grace walks in.

                                THERESA
                   Gracie. I didn’t know you were coming in
                   today. I would have cleared myself for
                   lunch.

        Grace looks at Theresa, tears already in her eyes. She
        waits for the last person to leave and closes the door.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                         (trying to stay casual)
                   Did you see Isabel on the way out?

        Grace ignores it. She turns and looks and looks at
        Theresa, unwavering. Theresa can’t ignore what’s coming.

                                GRACE
                         (plainly)
                   Why didn’t you tell me?
Pink Rev. (05/28/18)              BF7                    111.


  Grace seems intensely vulnerable, but clear. Theresa
  doesn’t know what to say.

                          GRACE (CONT'D)
                   (hurt)
              Why didn’t you tell me yourself?

  She looks away.

                          GRACE (CONT’D)
             You were lying; every minute you knew and
             didn’t tell me.

  Theresa looks away.

                          THERESA
             I’m sorry.

  Grace’s emotions are colliding.

                          GRACE
             Everybody’s sorry!

  Theresa looks at her, tenderly.

                          THERESA
             I didn’t want to make you sad.

  Grace tears up.

                          GRACE
             And you didn’t think I’d be sad If you
             just died one day?

                          THERESA
             No. I...

  Theresa struggles.

                          GRACE
             What?

                          THERESA
             I didn’t want anything to change. People
             act differently sometimes.

                          GRACE
             How would you know? You didn’t tell
             anyone!

  Theresa nods.

                          THERESA
             Maybe I was wrong.

        They sit facing each other. Grace cries. Theresa stokes
        her face. Grace looks lost.

                                GRACE
                   If I knew you were dying, I wouldn’t have
                   spent my time doing other stuff.

        Grace starts to sob. Theresa holds her hands and kisses
        them.

                                THERESA
                   Don’t cry sweet heart. Don’t. It’s okay,
                   you’ll be okay.

        Grace is shaking her head.

                                GRACE
                   I don’t want to be okay!

                                THERESA
                   And Isabel will be with you...

        Grace looks up at Theresa, feelings colliding.

                                GRACE
                   I don’t care about Isabel! You’re my mom.
                   I don’t want anyone but you. If you don’t
                   tell me, I can’t say all the things I
                   want to say...

        Tears begin to run down Theresa’ cheeks.

                                GRACE (CONT’D)
                   I can’t tell you that... I love you...
                   and I don’t want you to die.

        Theresa cries with her. They hold each other. Kiss each
        other’s tears. Theresa looks at Grace, nose-to-nose. She
        holds her face.

                                 THERESA
                   I love you.

        We find Grace’s hand, as she intertwines a lock of
        Theresa’ hair tightly through her fingers, grasping. She
        won’t let go. They cry.


151     INT./ EXT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S HOUSE                       151

        We see a series of shots around the grounds and inside
        the house. Most of them are either nature: A deer
        drinking out of the pool - or inanimate objects in the
        house that having meaning to the make-up of their lives.

        A book on the table with the ring of a coffee cup on it.

        In Oscar’s studio, the huge stone, waiting.

        Pieces of the architecture of the house.

        The boys clothes in the hamper.


152     INT. THERESA CLOSET - EVENING                              152

        Close on the birds nest with the broken eggs that have
        been glued. We can see the cracks.

        Past the nest, we focus on Theresa’s dressing table where
        she sits, looking in the mirror. She wears a beautiful
        dress and is made-up.

        After a moment Oscar appears, dressed nicely, looking
        handsome, holding a glass of water which he sets down for
        Theresa. She takes a couple pills, not having to hide it
        any more.

        Oscar pulls reading glasses out of his pocket and kneels
        down next to her, facing her profile and holds out his
        hand. She hands him the earrings she’s having trouble
        with.

                                THERESA
                   This pair always gives me trouble.

        He puts on his reading glasses and focuses on getting the
        post through her earring hole. It’s very intimate.

                                OSCAR
                   I love being needed. Makes me horny.

        She can’t move but she rolls her eyes and smiles.

                                  OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   Almost...

        We see them in the mirror, she watches him in the
        reflection, taking in the whole thing.

        He smiles and finishes.

                                OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   One more second...

        He takes Theresa’s phone off the table and holds it
        behind them as they pose in the mirror for a selfie.

        Theresa walks down the hall and we follow her.    She comes
        to the boys room and pushes the door open.

        The boys are already in their PJ’s. They have a couple of
        friends over. They are all playing “Dance, Dance
        Revolution”, on X-Box; all dancing like maniacs.

        She watches them for a moment then walks in front of the
        TV blocking it, facing the boys.

                                THERESA
                   A dance party! Oh good! I love to dance!

        She starts to dance. They yell and scream, trying to get
        her to move. The twins try and push her out. She just
        keeps dancing.

                                TWINS (OTTO AND THEO)
                   Mom, this is serious, get out of the way.

                   I didn’t know it was serious! I’m sorry.

        She hugs them, and they go right back to playing.

        Oscar drives. Theresa looks out her window. Music plays.
        After a moment, Oscar turns to her; sensing him, she
        turns to him. Oscar opens his mouth, about to speak.

                                                              CUT TO:

        Theresa, Oscar, and about 30 others, have taken over the
        whole back room of this village bistro. A mixture of

157     OVERLAP ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’ BEING SUNG                       157

        Oscar carries out a cake that looks more like a
        sculpture. Clearly his brainchild.

        He sets it down as everyone finishes singing happy
        birthday. Theresa looks embarrassed by the show of
        affection. She looks at the crazy cake.

  Takes a deep breath and blows out the candles. It takes a
  couple tries. People clap. Theresa looks at Oscar and
  shakes her head, as if to say, “I hate/love that you did
  this”.

  He takes some icing on his finger and offers it to her.
  Theresa shakes her head but eats it. A deep breath and
  she stands.

                          THERESA
             Okay, okay...

  Everyone claps.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Thank you, thank you very much.
             Just to be clear, my birthday is not
             until next month and 52 is not exactly a
             landmark birthday, but thank you for
             being here and for this cake which is
             clearly a creation of my husbands fertile
             imagination.

  She gazes at him.

                           THERESA (CONT’D)
                    (to the crowd)
             I think you all know that he’s a
             brilliant artist. You see his work all
             over our office.
                    (promoting)
             But you may not know that he has a show
             up - at Anita Rodgers on Greene...                    *
             between Spring and Broome. So if you’re               *
             in the neighborhood stop by. Maybe buy a
             piece?

  People laugh. Theresa refocuses.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
                   (a moment)
             I had always thought of artists as flaky
             and impractical. So you can imagine my
             surprise when I fell in love with one. I
             thought I was going to marry a nice
             banker.

  A big laugh.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             But thank goodness there are no nice
             bankers.

  More laughter. Theresa looks down at Oscar. A long pause.
Pink Rev. (05/28/18)           BF7                          117.


                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Do you know what he said to me in the car
             on the way here?

  He takes a deep breath. She turns back to the crowd and
  quotes him.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             ‘Is it us moving through the world, or
             the world running past us?’

  Some sounds of acknowledgement from the group. She’s very
  emotional but pushes it back.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             To which I replied, “Let’s not take the
             Northern State, traffic is horrible this
             time of day”

  Lots of laughter. She looks at Oscar and mouths “I love
  you”. He takes her hand and kisses it.

  Theresa gathers and switches back to business mode.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             But this is not about me, it’s not about
             my family. This is about us and our
             company and what we’ve accomplished.
             Together. I know that many of you are
             wondering what our company is going to
             look like after the sale.

  She makes brief eye contact with Grace who sits listening
  next to Isabel. Theresa turns away and addresses the
  other guests.

                          THERESA (CONT'D)
             I’d be lying if I didn’t acknowledge that
             there will be a period of transition.
             But I must stress how important it was
             for me to find a partner who would not
             just continue our culture, but add to it.
             Making it more dynamic, with more
             resources, greater reach. So if you ask
             yourself do I feel uncomfortable and the
             answer is yes, then GOOD, cause that kind
             of discomfort leads to growth. That kind
             of discomfort makes you challenge
             yourself, that kind of discomfort is
             transformative...

  Oscar looks down at Grace and Isabel.

158     LATER IN THE EVENING                                      158

        Tables and chairs have been moved and a dance party has
        broken out.

        Pure abandon, as everyone dances. Oscar and Theresa let
        loose.


159     INT. THERESA AND OSCAR’S BEDROOM - 2AM                    159

        Theresa sits on the bed in her nightgown and robe, she
        looks tired and pale. Oscar brushes his teeth in the
        bathroom. Her back is turned to him.

                                OSCAR
                   I meant to tell you, the school called to
                   suggest that we split the boys into
                   separate classes after winter break. They
                   think it would be good for their
                   confidence.

        Oscar finishes brushing and comes in.

                                OSCAR (CONT’D)
                   I just worry about that one teacher,
                   Janet... She seems a little melancholy
                   for 3rd grade.

        She doesn’t answer. Looks to be really struggling.

                                THERESA
                   Why are you telling me this?

        Oscar sees she doesn’t look good. He goes to her.

                                OSCAR
                   Are you okay? Let me get you a
                   painkiller.

        He goes.

                                THERESA
                   I don’t want it.

        Oscar stops. He sits with her.

                                THERESA (CONT’D)
                   I want to know why you are telling me
                   this? About the boys.

        Oscar looks at her, confused.

                          OSCAR
             Because we have to decide...

  Theresa looks at him.

                          THERESA
             We don’t need to decide anything anymore.

  Oscar swallows hard. She is exhausted and vulnerable.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             You need to decide on your own because
             I’m not going to be here.

  Oscar is pained. Theresa can’t believe her own words.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             I’m not going to be here.

  She is baffled. Oscar puts his arms around her. She takes
  him and makes her look at him.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Do you think you’ll be with Isabel when
             I’m gone?

  Oscar shakes his head.

                           OSCAR
             Stop.

                          THERESA
             I want to know...

                          OSCAR
             Theresa, I love you.

  She looks desperate.

                          THERESA
             I don’t feel well.

  Oscar holds her and she lets him. Suddenly, she looks
  terrified.

                          THERESA (CONT’D)
             Where will I go?

  She’s like a child asking about death.

        He looks at her filled with compassion.

                                OSCAR
                   I don’t know.

        She lets all her anger and fear out while he holds her.

                                THERESA

                   I’m not done! I’m not done!

        She slides out of his arms and onto the floor, thrashing
        and struggling. Oscar tries to contain her.

                                OSCAR
                   I know, baby, I know...

        He holds her as she screams and sobs.

        On feet walking. Nature sounds.

        Wider to see Oscar, Isabel, Grace, and the boys walk in
        the woods together, holding a box of Theresa’s ashes.

        They stop in a clearing and open the box. Oscar turns the
        box over and the ashes blow. They all watch as the ashes
        disappear into the air and the earth.

        Isabel leans down and helps one of the twins zip up his
        sweatshirt. The camera moves past them to find Oscar’s
        sculpture sitting in the woods. He has shaped and
        intertwined the stone he was working on with part of the
        fallen tree and it stands quietly amongst the forest. A
        memorial.

        Isabel gets out of the cab in front of the orphanage.

        She breathes deeply, taking it all in. A moment later
        Preena appears. She and Isabel embrace. Preena takes
        Isabel’s hand and excitedly leads her in.

        They walk into the courtyard. Changes are already
        noticeable.

        Preena happily points things out.

         - Boxes that contain medical supplies. Food.

         - New soccer goals on the field.

         - IN THE SLEEPING AREA: New mattress and bunks. Isabel
        smiles.

        She goes through the few belongings she has. Not a lot.
        Remnants from another life. She divides it in a ‘to keep’
        pile, and a ‘throw away’.

        She hears some voices of children who are returning from
        their errands.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
                   (tenderly)
             To live.

  Jai’s little brow furrows.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             We could come back here and visit as much
             as you want.

                          JAI
             But this is my home. I want to stay here.

  Isabel’s face falls for a moment. Not what she was
  expecting.

                          JAI (CONT’D)
             I would miss my friends.

  Isabel nods. She wants to make sure he understands.

                          ISABEL
             The thing is, I have to live there. So we
             won’t see each other as much.

   Jai thinks it over for a moment.

                          JAI
             You can come and visit.

  She thinks, then nods.

                           ISABEL
             I can.

  We hear the other kids beginning to play on the soccer
  field. Jai’s attention is drawn there.

                          ISABEL (CONT’D)
             You want to go play?

  He nods enthusiastically.

                           ISABEL (CONT’D)
             Okay, go.

  He smiles. One more hug then he’s off.

166     INT. ISABEL’S OLD ROOM, INDIA - CONTINUOUS                   166

        Isabel walks back in her room, alone. ON HER FACE as she
        gathers herself emotionally.

        Something across the   room catches her eye. It’s a little
        mirror she kept over   her wash basin. She sees herself in
        the reflection. Lets   herself look. It’s one of those
        naked moments, where   you can really see yourself.


167     EXT. ORPHANAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER                         167

        A game is being played on the soccer field. Jai runs
        after the ball.

        Isabel appears on the periphery of the field and watches.
        As she does, we rise up and up; bird’s point of view.

                                               SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK.
