                     LIONEL (V.O.)

           your story walking, pal...’


INT/EXT LIONEL CAR - HARLEM ST - DAY

A beat up ‘54 Dodge sits on a cold Harlem street. Two guys
in the front.

                     LIONEL (V.O.) CONT
           He was more philosophical than your
           average gumshoe, but he liked to do
           his talking on the move so...
           Here’s how it all went down.

Close on the TWO GUYS: LIONEL ESSROG and GILBERT CONEY.
CONEY is a big lug in a porkpie hat. LIONEL medium build,
wiry. Both late 30’s. They don’t look like P.I.’s but
that’s what they are.

Lionel sits shotgun. He’s a hypnotizing array of Tourettic
twitches and tics.

                     LIONEL (V.O.)
           I got something wrong with my head,
           that’s the first thing to know

                       LIONEL
                 (yelps)
           IF!

                     LIONEL (V.O.)
           It’s like having glass in the
           brain. I can’t stop picking things
           apart, twisting em around, words
           and sounds especially. It’s like an
           itch that has to be scratched.

C.U. A   LOOSE THREAD...hanging off the sleeve of a sweater.
An arm   and a wrist resting on a seated knee. The knee
starts   to jiggle and then...FINGERS pluck at the thread,
try to   snap it off then smooth it down.

                     CONEY
           Quit pullin’ at it. You’re gonna
           make a fuckin’ mess outta things.

                     LIONEL
           I got threads in my heads! I got
           threads in my HEADS! I GOT THREADS
           IN MY HEADS, MAN!

This is LIONEL. Words are the fuel for the boiling pressure-
cooker of his obsessive-compulsive brain. CONEY ignores the
outburst, used to it. He stuffs little White Castles in his
mouth and watches Lionel, deadpan. Lionel’s head twitches.

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         And I twitch a lot. It’s hard to
         miss. Makes me look like a goddam
         spastic but if I try to hold it
         back it just makes it worse.

He’s pulling it out further, more thread unravelling. A
disaster...Lionel’s pulled a foot of thread off his cuff
before Coney reaches for his pocketknife...

                   CONEY
         Like I said, a fucking mess.
             (cuts it off)
         Jesus, freakshow. Ruin another
         sweater.

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         Fucking mess is right. The nuns
         said my soul wasn’t at peace with
         God and I should do penance. Frank
         said anyone teaching God’s love
         while they hit you with a stick
         should be ignored on every subject.

Lionel’s eyes are down the street, watchful and sharp.
Black kids playing football in the cold.

LIONEL’s POV: way off down the block a figure approaching.

Lionel: sharpens up. A flicker of a grin.

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         Frank Minna. If you had to pick
         just one guy to be on your side,
         he’s the one you’d want. It’s
         Minna’s game. We’re all just in the
         lineup.

TAP TAP TAP... at the window. A trim black trench-coat. A
smiling face under a cool hat , upturned collar against the
cold. Now that’s what a P.I. looks like and this one is:

FRANK MINNA.   Lionel rolls the window down.

                    MINNA
         Boys.

                    CONEY
         Boss.

                   LIONEL
         Heya, Frank. FRANKLY FRANKADY
         FRANKO!

Lionel reaches out and taps Minna twice on the shoulder. An
affectionate compulsion. Frank doesn’t even notice it
anymore. He lights a cigarette.

                   MINNA
         Okay listen...here’s the shot...
         I’ll be third floor. Lionel go to
         the payphone on the corner in 20
         minutes. When they come.. probably
         three or four of em...when they
         come, you call me here...
             (hands him a number)
         I’ll buzz em in. Coney waits on
         the door, I buzz him in and he
         stays right inside. Lionel’s
         listening sharp on the line. If
         you hear me say “Then we have a
         problem” hustle over, Coney lets
         you in, two of you come upstairs
         and back me up quick, okay?

                   CONEY
         What’s going down here, Frank?

                   MINNA
             (pause)
         I gotta keep this one under my
         hat, boys.

                   LIONEL
         Fat cats in HATS!

                   MINNA
         Them’s the ones, pal. Let’s catch
         a big score and get outta this
         game, get fat ourselves.

He winks at Lionel. Lionel notices a little sweat on
Minna’s brow despite the cold.

                   CONEY
         Boss, we’re not carrying.

                   MINNA
         What?

                   CONEY
         A piece. I don’t have a piece.

          MINNA
A piece? Say ‘gun’, Gilbert.

          CONEY
I got no gun.

          MINNA
That’s what I count on. That’s how
I sleep at night, you with no gun.
I’ve got a gun. You just show up.
I wouldn’t want you chuckleheads
coming up a stairway for me with a
hairpin. With a harmonica.

          LIONEL
Hairy chin. Harmony harp. Don’t
wind me up.

          MINNA
    (smiling at Lionel)
With an unlit cigar. With a
fucking chicken wing. Right,
Brooklyn?

          LIONEL
Chicky wing ding!
    (grins)
Quit winding me up! You’ll throw
me off. Just give us the rest of
it.

          MINNA
Right. Now, if I say “Lemme use
the can.” it means we’re coming
out. Get Gil, get in the car and
get ready to follow. And stay
tight, I might need to give
someone the slip, got it?

          LIONEL
‘Problem’- up the stairs, ‘use the
can’- start the car. Got it. Get,
gotten, got, GOTCHA!

          MINNA
Lionel’s got it. Just follow his
lead.

          CONEY
    (protesting)
You gotta be kidding me...

                    MINNA
          Coney what did I say when I came
          into the office last Tuesday?

                    CONEY
          Huh?

                    MINNA
          Lionel?

                    LIONEL
              (rapid fire)
          Took your coat off, put your hat
          on the 3rd hook, said “I just
          stood next to a girl on the ferry
          and the smile she gave me will get
          me through this winter” Threw
          Danny your notebook. “How’s a guy
          supposed to keep a marriage
          together when 22 is on the menu?”

                    MINNA
          (nods) Like I said, Lionel’s on
          point.

And he heads across the street

                    LIONEL
          Sit on it, Bailey!   IF!


INT/EXT SAME CAR - 20 MINUTES LATER

Coney is reading the paper, Lionel is locked on the street
and the door. Lionel is carefully folding a stick of gum
exactly in half before putting it in his mouth.

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          Fucking Bailey. Bailey is what my
          head calls me. It calls me out if I
          try to resist it. There’s things
          that calm it down: gum, weed,
          sometimes something stronger if I’m
          in bad shape. But if I try to put a
          lid on it it gets worse. If I get
          nervous it gets worse. If I get
          excited it gets worse. It’s the
          argument I can’t win.

The kids playing thump a football against Coney’s door.

                   CONEY
         Hey, watch it! (grumbling) Another
         Minna Classic. Freezin’ our asses
         off, don’t even know the score.

                   LIONEL
         What you got big plans this
         weekend, Coney? Coney Island! Coney
         Island hot dogs! Get your Coney
         Island hot dogs right here!!

                   CONEY
         Alright, Freakshow, just a little
         quieter please...

Lionel looks at his watch. Second hand hits the 12 and he
hits Coney in the arm.

                   LIONEL (cont’d)
         We’re on. Get ready.

Lionel hops out of the car and heads for a payphone.


INT. HARLEM APT/EXT HARLEM ST/PAYPHONE (INTERCUT) - DAY

C.U.: A PHONE, ringing on top of a dresser...

MINNA’S HAND reaches in and picks it up and off the screen.

                   MINNA
         Yeah.

                   LIONEL
         Hey, boss.
             (muted)
         Boss, bossy, BITCH!

                   MINNA
         You keeping it together, Brooklyn?

                   LIONEL
         Yeah...it’s under control. I got
         my gum. I got ya covered.

                   MINNA
         I know it. Okay, like we said,
         stay tuned in, pal. I’m might
         need that head of yours later.

                       Pink Revisions                    7.


Two men get out of each and converge on the sidewalk in
front of the building. One of them is A GIANT MAN IN A DARK
COAT...easily 7’0”.

                    LIONEL
          Hey. I think your friends are
          here.

In the apartment A DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS.

                    LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
              (reacting to the GIANT)
          Jesus look at the size of that
          guy. They got serious muscle with
          em...Everything cool, Boss?

                    MINNA
          Cool as can be. Just a little
          chat.

CLOSE ON: THE DRESSER as Minna opens the top drawer and
puts the phone down inside with the receiver still off the
cradle. LEAVES THE DRAWER OPEN A CRACK so Lionel can
listen in...

ON LIONEL: Looking over to...THE DOOR.    The four guys get
buzzed in.

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          ‘Here Lies Frank Minna. Cool as can
          be.’ They’ll carve that on his
          fucking tombstone. I don’t know if
          it was growing up in Greenpoint or
          fighting the Japanese, but he was
          cool under pressure in a way you
          can’t teach.

LIONEL leans out and waves to CONEY who hustles out of the
car and to the door, buzzes, enters, gives thumbs up.

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          I was just happy to have job on his
          team. And if there’s one thing my
          pain in the ass brain does know how
          to do...it’s listen and remember
          things.

Lionel folds up a handkerchief and rubber bands it to the
phone mouthpiece. He closes his eyes to focus and listen.

(We see the meeting in the apartment AS IMAGINED BY LIONEL,
and the action on the street around him and over all this
there’s NO SOUND but what Lionel hears through that phone
receiver in the dresser.)

LIONEL’S POV: Kids playing on the street.

                   MINNA
         Well, which part didn’t you
         understand?

         How about the part where you got
         the idea to go poke around after
         some colored broad for starters.

CU: Lionel mouths ‘colored broad’ silently to himself then--

         So, if you want to know what’s
         going in that report, that
         ‘colored broad’ is doing most of
         the legwork on Hamilton for ‘em.
         And what she’s sniffing around I’m
         sure is of concern to you
         gentlemen, so I put some time into
         that too.

           None of this can be proved.

                     MINNA
           That signature is the real deal.

                     LIEBERMAN
           If you knew the man, you’d know
           why that seems highly implausible
           to me.

                     MINNA
           I checked it against others. It’s
           his John Hancock. And the paper
           trail backs it up. Lay that on top
           of the rest of what I’ve included
           here and I think we can all agree
           you’re sitting on a powder keg.

           You think this is funny?

                     MINNA
           No, Lou, just ironic. There’s a
           difference. Look it up. Father’s
           a busted up vet. He runs a jazz

Sure. Nature of the game.

Excellent. We’ll need to get those

might talk about terms.

Terms?

beyond the original scope of work

A small sound -- a piece of paper being unfolded?

Lionel can’t hear...he’s nervous.

LIONEL’S POV: Cop car way down the street; a BLACK GUY
(BILLY ROSE) walking by lights a smoke, looks across the
street and moves on; Coney in the door

                   LOU
         Have you lost your mind?

                   MINNA
         Let’s not kid each other fellas.
         You got the biggest gravy train
         this century pulling out. I’m
         asking for a seat in the rear
         here.

                   LIEBERMAN
         That’s quite impossible.

                   MINNA
         I’d double this at any paper in
         town.

There is a sudden deadly silence.     Lionel senses it.

                   LOU
         I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say
         what you just said and we’re gonna-

         Just an observation. I’m here in
         good faith. Just assessing the
         value...

         You can forget it--

         Jeez Lou, what’s your beef with a
         guy getting paid for good work? I
         mean you get paid for doing
         nothing as far as I can--- UHHNH!

A THUD. LIONEL FREEZES.

It goes quiet...whispered conference that Lionel strains to
hear.

up the phone and turns to exit, then turns back and hangs
it up again, then dashes out...

         They hit him! It sounded like they
         hit him!

                   CONEY
         For chrissake, freakshow! What are
         we doing here?

He starts to get out but Lionel stops him.

                   LIONEL
         No. He said “lemme use the can”
         We’re supposed to follow him. CAN
         THE MAN!

They look across to...THE DOORWAY

MINNA and the FOUR MEN come out. THE GIANT and MINNA move
a step or two off while a SMALLER MAN (LOU) confers briefly
with the other two, whose faces are obscured.

LOU nods and they all split. The TWO MEN, still not
clearly seen, turn and hurry off the opposite direction
into a waiting car.

The GIANT and LOU move Minna toward the front car. Minna
looks okay...is he holding his side a little? He’s
definitely being escorted to the car. He moves as if to
turn toward them but THE GIANT takes him by the elbow and
herds him forward. MINNA shakes off the guy’s hand.

ON LIONEL AND CONEY

                   CONEY
         I don’t like it...

                   LIONEL
         Me neither, let’s go.

They pile out of the car, Gil has to wait as the SECOND
BLACK CAR goes by, losing a step on...

LIONEL, moving up the sidewalk fast, now directly across
the street as Frank gets pushed into the back seat of the
FIRST BLACK CAR

C.U. - LIONEL staring across at...FRANK, who sees him and
stares back. Is he nodding? Does he want help? What is
that look on his face? Hard to tell...he could be shaking
his head to back off...And then the other guy gets in,
blocking him, the car pulls out and he’s gone...

LIONEL AND CONEY scramble into the car, Gil at the wheel.
He revs it, clips the fender of the car parked in front of
them.

                   CONEY
         This fucking guy!

That gets even Coney to look over for a second as they
squeal out into...

Inside the car: with Lionel and Coney as they race, trying
to catch up. Lionel now highly agitated, looking to spot
the other car, looks left up the Avenue

Coney rips the wheel...

alongside, Lionel looks past Coney out the driver’s side
window

a cab stopped at a light. MINNA’S CAR is forced to a stop
too at the red light, cars crossing in front

INSIDE: LIONEL rips open the door...


EXT HARLEM AVENUE - STOPLIGHT

Lionel runs past the car in front of them and cuts across
in front of it, RIGHT INTO THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING CAR THAT
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, ALMOST BOUNCING HIM OFF ITS HOOD, but
he never stops, cutting up the lane toward...THE BLACK CAR.

But just as LIONEL gets within a few strides of it...

THE LIGHT GOES GREEN AND THE BLACK CAR SURGES FORWARD

He curses even as the CAR THAT ALMOST HIT HIM BLARES AT
HIM, forcing past...but HERE’S CONEY PULLING UP. LIONEL
RIPS OPEN THE DOOR AND WE SMASH CUT TO:

Racing up the avenue in the left lane, they can’t see the
BLACK CAR anywhere up ahead.

                   LIONEL
         We lost him!

Hidden beyond a TRUCK in the right lane up ahead, THE BLACK
CAR suddenly appears, making a HARD RIGHT and racing off
UNDER the structure of a massive bridge... CONEY almost
blasts past, but rips the turn from the middle lane,
forcing another car to brake, horn blaring. And now they
can see the car up ahead, whipping under the bridge toward
a dark turn ahead...

                   CONEY
         Where’s he going?

                   LIONEL
         The ramp... he’s going to Queens.

Lionel again rips open his door as they stop, standing up
next to the car in time to see...two lanes over to the
right, THE BLACK CAR BREAKS RIGHT OUT OF THE LANES and
heads for an empty lane marked ‘AUTHORIZED VEHICLES ONLY’,
as a TOLL OFFICER STEPS INTO THAT BOOTH.

The driver of the BLACK CAR flashes something at the guard
and THE CAR IS WAVED THROUGH.

                    LIONEL
          Son of a bitch!

He goes back inside but they’re boxed in and being
channeled into a booth. LIONEL hits CONEY in the arm.

                    LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
          QUACKER! QUOTER! QUARTER!

They scramble for the toll. Coney finds one and practically
throws it at the guy, barreling through the booth.

Lionel is tapping Coney’s shoulder manically.

THE CAR rips a left turn onto wider industrial avenue. The
streets are pretty desolate over here...a lot of warehouses

CONEY LEFT...

THE GIANT, striding toward a pile of trash, raising a .45
in his GLOVED HAND, pointing down. He looks up as CONEY
squeals to a stop 20 yards away.

LIONEL jerks open the door and shouts...

THE GIANT whips the gun up and pops off a SHOT and LIONEL
DUCKS AS IT THUNKS INTO THE EDGE OF HIS DOOR.

Coney turns back and grabs the HAT, throws it into the car,
slams the rear door and jumps into the driver seat, leaving
the door open. He rolls forward, scooping up Frank’s GUN on
the move, slams the door and GUNS IT.

         Boss, who was in that room?

                   MINNA
         Ah shit, Brooklyn, she’s in
         trouble now.

                   LIONEL
         Who, Frank? What went down in
         there?!

                   MINNA
             (shakes his head)
         Played outta my league...shoulda
         kept it...

He reaches for his head, getting manic.

He coughs up blood. They’re putting something in his arm.

                   LIONEL
         Blood Bag, Bailey!

                   NURSE
         Sir, you can’t be in here!

Minna grabs Lionel’s arm.

                   MINNA
             (really spacey now)
         Hey, Brooklyn...

                   LIONEL
         I’m here, Frank.

                   MINNA
         You’re no freak. Okay?

                   LIONEL
         Okay. Who did it, Frank?

Minna’s eyes are scared now. He’s trying to say something.

         You were working for those guys?

Minna shakes his head. Tries to whisper something.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
             (leaning down)
         What? What Frank?

                   MINNA
             (barely audible)
         Formosa...

                   LIONEL
         Formosa? What is that?

                    MINNA
             (mouthing)
         For..mos..

Minna’s head goes back. A DOCTOR reacts and moves in,
shoving Lionel out of the way.

                   DOCTOR
         Move!

                   NURSE
         Sir!!

She pushes Lionel back and away. He goes and picks FRANK’S
HAT up off the floor and backs out the SWINGING DOORS.

LIONEL’S FACE: Peering through the glass.

POV: a circle of white around the table with Minna’s black
wingtips sticking out. A Doctor’s shoulders going up and
down, and then...

SLOW MOTION: the shoulders stop and sag. A head shakes. The
doctor turns toward the door pulling his mask down.


INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

Doors open: the doctor comes into the hall. Lionel stands,
holding Frank’s hat and twitching violently.

                   LIONEL
         Guy walks into a bar...

                   DOCTOR
         Are you his friend?

Lionel taps him on the shoulder, nodding.

                    DOCTOR
          He didn’t make it.

                    LIONEL
          Oh no... A guy walks--

                    DOCTOR
          --I’m very sorry--

                    LIONEL
          --into a bar! SO SORRY, BAILEY!

LIONEL pushes past the doctor like a drowning man.    He’s
out of control. He needs air.

CONEY sees him coming and knows. He bows his head and tries
to slow Lionel down but Lionel blows past...


EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - MAGIC HOUR

Lionel explodes out of the building in despair. He looks up
at the sky, clutching Frank’s hat, ticc-ing and shouting.

FROM ABOVE: Coney walks out and stands with his hand on
Lionel’s shoulder...and we CUT TO:


EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE & NEW YORK SKYLINE - NIGHT

MAIN TITLE: MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN


INT. THE L&L AGENCY OFFICE - NIGHT

A low-rent office. A few desks in an open room; chairs on
rollers; filing cabinets. One door with frosted glass
leads to Minna’s office. Another to a darkroom.

LIONEL sits slumped in a chair, his bloody coat, Frank’s
hat and other stuff on the desk in front of him.

Coney leans against the wall smoking a cigarette.

TONY VERMONTE and DANNY FANTL sit on desks. TONY is slick.
A clothes horse, impatient to get to something better: the
leader of these four. DANNY’s early 40’s, skinny and a
little haunted...but solid, wise. A listener.

                   LIONEL
         He gave us the cue to follow. We
         made a move to get in...but he
         signaled me off...I think...

                   TONY
         You think? You said they roughed
         him up in the room though.

                   LIONEL
         I’m not sure. They mighta. Anyway
         he said “use the can” after that.
         Can the loose man.

                   TONY
         So he’s takin’ em to something
         they want and they off him? It
         doesn’t track.

                   LIONEL
         I told you he tried to give em the
         slip...I don’t know, it happened
         fast and we didn’t see it.

                   TONY
         How the fuck’d you drop so far off
         him?

                   LIONEL
             (exploding)
         I told you three times, Tony... We
         lost him at the bridge, they had
         some fucking badge! The fuck were
         we supposed to do?!

                   CONEY
         Freakshow’s right. It was a mess.

                   DANNY
         So who were they?

                   CONEY
         He wouldn’t say. Even in the car
         after.

                   TONY
             (pissed)
         Right. That’s great, Frank.

He throws a pen at Frank’s door and turns away exasperated.

A long glum silence.

           We gotta tell Julia.

Coney flicks a tiny look to Tony. Lionel sees it.

                     TONY
           I told her already.

                     DANNY

                     TONY
           She called looking for Frank.

                     LIONEL
           Timbuktuk-it. How’d she take it?

                     TONY
           How’d you think she took it, Freak-
           -

Lionel kicks a chair at him hard.

                     LIONEL
           Don’t say it again, I ain’t in the
           mood!

                     TONY
           Alright take it easy...I’m just
           saying...you know how she can be.

Silence.

                     DANNY
           Someone should take her his
           things.

An awkward pause. Nobody wants it.

                     LIONEL
           I’ll do it.

He stands and reaches for his coat but realizes it’s
covered in blood, his sweater too. Danny hops up, reaches
into Minna’s office door and grabs Frank’s old NAVY PEA
COAT. He hands it to Lionel, who balks but Danny pushes it
on him

                     DANNY
           Go on, take it. You can’t go walk
           around like that.

                   LIONEL
         I was with him. Maybe she’ll want
         to know what happened at the end.

He heads for the door.

                   TONY
         He say anything about her?

                   LIONEL
         No.

                   TONY
         Then help him out one last time
         and lie a little.


INT. FRANK & JULIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

LIONEL comes in through the foyer of a brownstone to the
first floor apartment.

The door opens on JULIA, Frank’s wife. Early forties,
blonde. Still really good-looking. But hard...out for
herself mostly.

She has a look on her face like she’s expecting someone and
when she sees Lionel, it falls a little.

                   JULIA
         Oh...Lionel.

                   LIONEL
             (awkward)
         Hi Julia...

                   JULIA
         Don’t bother. The hospital already
         called.

A strange little lie...

                   LIONEL
         No...I brought you Frank’s things.

                   JULIA
         Oh. I thought you were gonna break
         the news to me again.

He enters and puts the clothes on the table. She goes to
light a cigarette.

                   LIONEL

                   JULIA
         Yeah, nice twist huh? Didn’t see
         that one coming, I gotta say.

                   LIONEL
         Twisty twinky. Sorry.

Lionel is trying hard not to twitch around her but the
effort almost makes it worse. Lionel clearly makes her a
little uncomfortable.

                   JULIA
         Look, I just wanna be alone, okay?

                   LIONEL
         Sure.

He flips Frank’s hat onto the side table and dumps out of
it: a watch, a matchbook, some change, an address book,
Frank’s wallet...

                   JULIA
         Gimme the watch I guess. I don’t
         want all the rest of that stuff.

He hands it to her...

                   LIONEL
         I’m gonna keep his gun, if that’s
         okay with you.
             (she nods)
         You want his hat?

                   JULIA
         What for? Is there money in that
         wallet?

Lionel takes the money out of the wallet to hand to her

                   JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Jesus, it has blood on it, for
         chrissakes! I don’t wanna see
         that. Ain’t you got any sense?

Emotion is rising in her...Lionel scoops up the cash and
gun with the loose stuff and pockets what he can. He pauses
on one item: Frank’s wedding ring. She takes it and turns
it over and this actually gets her to tear up a little. She
sits on the couch.

                   JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Ah jeez...Was somebody with him
         anyway? When he...?

         it, I’m pissed at him!

                   JULIA
             (snaps)
         Well I am!

He lets out a yelp and she stares at him. She’s seen it
plenty of times but it’s still weird to her. He picks up
Frank’s hat and turns to go then pauses...

                   LIONEL
         Julia...Frank say anything to you
         about what he was working on?

                   JULIA
         He never told me what he was mixed
         up in. You got no idea who did it?

                   LIONEL
             (shakes his head)
         But if I figure it out, I’m gonna
         make ‘em regret it. I promise you
         that.

         Don’t promise me. It makes no
         difference to me one way or the
         other.

INT. LIONEL’S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Lionel mounts the stairs, tired, and turns on the landing.
He stops and sits down, almost out of sight behind the
bannister but we can see him put his head down and weep.


INT. LIONEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lionel enters takes off his coat and hat. He hangs Minna’s
hat up next to his on the wall... His weeping has turned
into twitches and small shouts that seem to be building...

A MIRROR reflects his bed. In it we see him sit only partly
visible on the edge of the bed, get something out of a
drawer (a small pipe) and then a match flares and we see
him inhaling something. He sets it down and takes a photo
off the side table

PHOTO: Much younger and cooler looking Frank Minna with his
arm around a young Lionel, skinny...both smiling.

ON LIONEL: eyes glazing, he smiles a little and lets
himself fall back onto the bed...


INT. LIONEL’S DREAM/SWIMMING POOL

As he hits the sheets they ripple TURNING INTO AMBER
COLORED WATER. Lionel sinks slowly, happily, eyes open

We see him sinking fully clothed in a limitless pool of
water with amber light dancing around him and as he
sinks...

...a SHADOWY FIGURE swims past on the surface above him.

water, dancing with amber light, A MAN SWIMS HARD ON THE

A HUGE PUBLIC INDOOR POOL of the kind they don’t build
anymore. Stained glass, beautiful tile, etc.

It’s early morning, dawn light cracking in, and the steam
and the light dance on the water. A LONE FIGURE swims
powerful laps. Back and forth without pause. A YOUNG AIDE
in a suit sits on a bench in the shadows with a valise full
of papers in his lap waiting.

Finally the swimmer climbs straight up out of the water,
his back to us. He’s powerfully built. A BLACK POOL
ATTENDANT emerges out of the shadows to put a robe around
him and the YOUNG AIDE in the suit hurries to catch up as
THE MAN exits.


EXT. PUBLIC ATHLETIC CLUB - MORNING

A SMALL FLAG with an unfamiliar insignia decorates one
corner of a BIG BLACK CAR’s hood. THE LICENSE PLATE reads
“BA 1”.

WIDE: by the doors of the MEN’s side of the public
bathhouse. About a dozen people wait in the cold and
spitting RAIN to be let in to swim. The doors burst open
and an umbrella is thrown up by the DRIVER for THE MAN,
shielding his face from view as he descends the stairs.

                   MAN (MOSES RANDOLPH)
         Let em in, Charlie.

With his entourage, he heads down the steps to the car in
the pre-dawn grey. His aide takes the umbrella and hands
over the valise as the MAN climbs in and the car pulls
away, leaving him standing in the rain.

address. The crowd APPLAUDS.

column.

strong jaw, as others applaud he looks at his watch.

flashing eyes and big hawkish nose, coming like a
juggernaut until

HE’S RIGHT ON US, SLAPPING THE FORM DOWN, FURIOUS

                   THE MAN (MOSES RANDOLPH)
         NOW SIGN IT!

THIS IS MOSES RANDOLPH.

THE MAYOR: stares for a beat...then pulls the form toward
him and, on his first day in office, he does as he’s told.

                   RANDOLPH
         Right! Bunch of fucking amateurs.

He snatches up the form and leaves.

Awkward silence.

                   MAYOR
         Close that damn door and keep it
         closed!


INT. LIONEL’S APARTMENT - MORNING

A RADIO PLAYS.

                   NEWS ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
         ...new life in talks between the
         City and Dodgers owner Walter
         O’Malley who wants a site and
         financing for a new stadium to
         keep the boys in Brooklyn...

LIONEL shuts it off. Coat on. Goes to take his cap.

TWO HATS on the wall. He stares a beat, then takes...

MINNA’S HAT. He holds it a moment. He puts it on his head
to check the size. Pretty good fit. He checks it in the
mirror, straightens the brim and goes.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - SAME MORNING

A bundle of World Telegram Suns slaps down and has the cord
cut off.

“MEET THE NEW BOSS: Mayor’s Full Inaugural ”

LIONEL walks past and down the block, nursing a coffee,
past boys hawking papers...

                    PAPERBOY
          Dodgers can stay if City will give
          em a Yard!

He passes volunteers for the Committee Against
Discrimination in Housing tacking flyers up to a telephone
pole.


INT. THE L&L OFFICE - MORNING

Lionel enters to find...

THE OFFICE HAS BEEN TRASHED, turned upside down.

The other guys are already there and Julia is sitting in a
chair, crying a little, shaken. Tony’s comforting her.

                    JULIA
          ...asking all kinds a
          questions...I told em “Christ he’s
          dead, what are you gonna arrest
          him?”

                    CONEY
              (to Lionel)
          ..the fuck you been? Called you
          all morning.

                    LIONEL
          What the hell happened?

                    CONEY
          Danny had a early run out to
          Belmont. Came in and found it like
          this.

                    DANNY

         ...assholes. Picking in my
         underwear drawer and grinning at
         me.

                   TONY
         We’re gonna find out who did this
         and get to the bottom of it, right
         boys?

                   JULIA
         I don’t even wanna know. Always
         with his cryptic shit, telling me
         he was into something big this
         time...gonna change our situation.

She weeps a little more...for Frank or for herself? Tony
pats her back as Danny shoots Lionel a look. She gets
herself together.

                   JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Look I know the car service was
         mostly for the books but he never
         talked about how he ran the snoop
         work and I ain’t interested. So
         I’m putting Tony in charge. He’ll
         handle the business of it and keep
         me in the loop.
             (pause)
         I know you all go way back with
         him, longer than me, but that’s
         just the way it is for now I
         guess.

                   TONY
         Sure, doll. It’s the right thing.

                   CONEY AND DANNY
         ‘Course. Sure.

Lionel nods.

          my sister for a while...think
          about my future. But call me...you
          know.. with an update?

Tony goes to open the door. She shakes hands with Coney and
Danny, who kisses her on the cheek. Lionel rises and goes
to shake her hand but he has to tap her shoulder twice. She
reacts, annoyed.

                    JULIA (cont’d) (CONT’D)
          Can’t you ever cut that out?! For
          once!

                     LIONEL
          Sorry...

Tony rolls his eyes and leads her out the door.

          Touch it, Bailey!

Danny and Lionel start picking up papers and files.

                    DANNY
          Assholes even pulled the tank off
          the john.

Tony enters.

                    TONY
          Alright, forget that, do it later.
          Right now, just the four of us:
          Does anybody know what Frank was
          into on this?

Nobody.

                    CONEY
          He just told us to meet him for a
          sit. He didn’t even make like it
          was a big thing.

                    LIONEL
          He was nervous though.

                    TONY
          Nervous how?

                   CONEY
         He wasn’t nervous.

                   LIONEL
         Were you on that line, dumbshit?
         I’m telling you he was nervous.
         Nervous Nellie! I could hear it.
         He was making some kind of a play.
         There’s something big going down a
         week from Thursday and whatever he
         found they weren’t happy about it.

                   CONEY
         Obviously. They whacked him for
         it.

                   LIONEL
         CRACK WACKER! I don’t think they
         meant to...I think when they shot
         him the they messed up and now
         they’re stuck looking for whatever
         he found.

                   TONY
         Some fuckin’ riddle. Jesus H.
             (weighing it)
         I’m gonna say this: I loved the
         guy. When we were in that fucking
         hell hole he saw something in us
         and threw us a line...taught us
         how to operate. But he never cut
         us in all the way. He played his
         own games and I’m not gonna stick
         my nose around his dead cards and
         risk ending up on a slab for it.
             (beat)
         I say we got bills to pay and we
         better get at it.

Coney and Danny nod.

                   LIONEL
         You owe him more’n that, T.

                   TONY
         Yeah? Well you figure out what the
         fuck it was all about, let us
         know. Meantime, I’m finishing up
         on the rabbi’s wife. She’s banging
         a butcher who ain’t kosher so I
         think he’s really gonna give her
         the boot this time and that’s
         gonna be the last of that ride.

Lionel stares at Tony. So this is how it’s going to be.

Lionel shrugs, his mind still on Minna.


INT. THE L&L OFFICE (1 HOUR LATER) - DAY

FINGERS PULLING THE THREAD

LIONEL sits by the window, holding Minna’s hat, staring out
at the street. He has fixed up the office --
immaculate...compulsively ordered.

         Before we were Minna’s men we were

                      LIONEL (V.O.)
            I was worse in there. Total
            freakshow. Nobody knew what to do
            with me. The nuns thought they
            could beat it out of me. One in
            particular. Until Tony grabbed the
            paddle out of her hand and told
            her if she hit me again he’d give
            it to her twice as hard. Coney
            and Danny were standing behind him
            and she knew they weren’t
            bluffing. After that, I was in
            their crew.

         Frank was just from the
         neighborhood. He was smart.
         Everybody knew he was going places.
         Everybody liked him. He was friends
         with one of the priests and heard I
         had a thing for remembering numbers
         and words. He had uses for that. He
         was the one who taught me how to
         use my head, get it under control,
         make it work for me. He took all
         us is under his wing eventually.
         Gave us a place in this shitty
         world.

His car slides up on a club marquee. “THE FORMOSA”.

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         Frank didn’t have to cover for me,
         he just never put me out into
         situations that were going to punch
         my buttons. Talking to people,
         getting information out of em,

50’s supper club. Classy. Lionel comes in and looks around.
It’s afternoon empty. Latin guys setting the floor tables.

There’s a HOSTESS cleaning up candles from tables

         That’s him.

The bartender looks a beat. Shakes his head

                   BARTENDER
         Everybody looks like everybody to
         me. But I don’t think so. She’s
         good with faces.

The HOSTESS slides up, overhearing, and indicates to let
her see the photo. Studies it then shakes her head but
takes in Lionel: kinda cute. She smiles, flirts.

         Nice face.

Lionel opens the matchbook. Lights one and starts to hold
it for her as she leans -- then blows it out.

eyebrows raise...

         it.

Starts to pocket the matches and change...

                   BARTENDER
         That uptown shit’s the real deal,
         huh? You get up there much?

Lionel stops -- no idea what he’s talking about.    The guy
points at the matchbook

                   BARTENDER (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         King Rooster.

Lionel turns the matchbook over. A ROOSTER WITH A CROWN ON
A RED BACKGROUND.

LIONEL -- staring. Where’d he get this? Opens it.

“B.A. - 2:30” written in a familiar hand. Realizes...It was
in Minna’s pants.

                   LIONEL
         I don’t know it.

                   BARTENDER
         Jazz joint in Harlem. Lucky’s is a
         good time too but the all the guys
         playing Hard are at the Rooster.

LIONEL -- “a jazz club in Harlem”.   He’s moving.

INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - DAY

A small dark Harlem joint. Bar, tables and a little space
for the band in a paneled corner that’s hardly even a
stage.

Black bartender setting up. THREE BLACK GUYS at a back
table talking low. One with his back to the bar.

LIONEL enters and quick looks check him out. One guy, 50’s
very dark black skin, looks at Lionel in the mirror long
and hard, watchful.

                   BARTENDER
         We ain’t open yet.

                   LIONEL
         Can I get an early one? I’m
         freezing here. Whiskey neat.

He slaps a bill up.     The bartender’ll take that.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
             (fishing)
         Say, you the manager?

                   BARTENDER
         I look like the manager?

                   LIONEL
         Who’s playing tonight?

                   BARTENDER
             (at the THREE GUYS)
         Hey, Billy...

The DARK-SKINNED GUY with his back to the bar looks over.
Lionel meets eyes with him in the mirror behind the bar.

                   BARTENDER (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Who’s on tonight?

                   BILLY
         Mr Big Shot.

His eyes locked on    Lionel, he puts a cigarette in his mouth
with his left hand    and then using the same hand to snap
open a lighter and    light it...highlighting that his RIGHT
ARM HANGS LIMP AND    USELESS. Lionel still staring. Does he
know that face?

                   BARTENDER
         I hope they don’t think they
         drinking free.

He tries to make it seem like a sneeze. He’s getting
excited and that winds up his tics. He’s got to get out.

                    LIONEL (cont’d)
          Catch him another time. If!

                    BARTENDER

Lionel’s out the door and we CUT TO:


INT. LIONEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A RECORD SPINNING, a standard playing, sad but soothing.

Camera pans over to find LIONEL in a chair by the radiator
with a joint. His head is moving as though he can’t get a
kink out of his neck. Or can’t shake his brain.

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          On my average day the weed will
          handle my twitching and shouting
          but it makes my thinking fuzzy.

A CAT, comes over and climbs up in his lap. He pets her and
this contact seems to calm him as he looks out the window
at the lights on the street.

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          In my dreams I’m calm and clear
          like I was when I was a kid. Even
          after my head started messing with
          me, my mother could settle it down.
          She’d sing soft songs and stroke
          the back of my neck and it would
          leave me for a while. We’d lie on
          the bed and talk about all of the
          places we were gonna go.

The sad trumpet carries us over into....

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - MORNING

It’s cold and clear. Lionel’s got a coffee. People are
hustling for the subway.

Lionel comes past a telephone pole close to camera, flicks
his eyes at the flyers on it and EXITS...

PIECES OF PAPER posted to the pole rustle in the cold...

...and Lionel comes back into frame, looking closer at one
of the flyers, reading:

Lionel enters Danny’s reading the paper. Tony’s on the
phone, pissed...

          Well, Christ, Coney, did you get
          the shot or not?...doing
          what?...Getting the paper ain’t
          worth shit! The fuck does that
          have to do with his back?...
          Bending over, my ass, we gotta
          have him lifting the lawnmower out
          the car or playing tennis or
          spinning around the room with some
          broad sittin’ up on his tentpole
          and his arms out wide. I don’t
          care so long as it involves his
          back!...I know he’s fakin’ all the
          time, that’s why he’s won three
          claims! Wait him out or set him
          up!... I know it’s cold, that’s
          why they call it winter!

He hangs up.   Sees Lionel looking at him. That was his
case.

         If the guy lifted a cow into a
         truck, Coney’d still miss the
         shot. He still can’t remember to
         wind the film. Thinks it’s a Tommy-

Tony makes a pansy flick with his wrist, throws on his
scarf and hustles out.

                   LIONEL
         Hey, D... You up for something?

                   DANNY
         Like what?

         Sit on a joint for me.

                    DANNY
         For you?

Lionel tosses him the matchbook.

                   LIONEL
         Club up in Harlem. I think Frank
         was there that day or the day
         before...it was in his pants,
         almost full. Fullsie Pants!

                   DANNY
             (skeptical)
         Maybe he stopped in for a book of
         matches.

LIONEL glances out the window as they talk and sees...

TONY, across the street outside the coffee shop stopping at
the payphone.

                   LIONEL
         In the room he was talking about a
         girl, a colored chick. Something
         she knew had em pretty unhappy,
         wondering who else knew. Frank
         said her father is a busted up vet
         who runs a club...this joint is
         three blocks from that meet.

         Well if you got nothing better to
         do... sit on it a while, see if
         she shows.

INT. LIONEL’S CAR - DAY

He drifts through Brooklyn.


EXT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - DAY

Lionel crosses the street heading for a nondescript office
building. Checks the address and enters.


INT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - A HALLWAY - DAY

Lionel finds a door with just a number on it. Checks his
info again, takes out a piece of gum, folds it exactly in
half and pops it in his mouth and then enters into...


INT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

An open space with desks pushed up against one another. Low
budget informality. A few private offices with doors at the
far end and right in front by the door...

Lionel enters and goes to close the door but has to re-open
it and close it twice more to make it sound right. He’s
good at stakeouts, not at this part. HIS EYES flick
around...

People busy at work on phones, typing, filling out forms,
conferring with each other. A few middle-aged Jewish men
and women, and, Lionel immediately notices, FOUR YOUNG
BLACK WOMEN, working in different parts of the room: one
typing, one walking papers back to one of the offices...

One at a reception desk, looking up at Lionel.

         Josephine or Laura?

She points at each as she says their names and Lionel makes
note of their faces.

                   LIONEL
         No I’m sure it was Mildred. She
         spoke to me on the phone about my

hunch turns back and takes a flyer...

             (really confused now)
         She’s in the back...oh there she
         is...

They look and see Gabby Horowitz, director of the
Committee, just stepping from her office with LAURA, one of
the black girls. They see Betty pointing and look up.

Lionel waves and points as though to say “I’ll see you
outside” and quickly exits...

Gabby and LAURA look at each other. Who the hell was that?

DANNY HAS BEEN BEATEN UP.   He is very shaken, out of
breath.

Tony moves Danny to a chair and loosens his tie.

Danny motions that he needs a drink and CONEY quickly pours
him a shot from a bottle in a desk.

Danny downs it with a shaky hand.

He grabs a few photos off the stack and moves them to the
back...

- A black woman entering the club but too much from the
back

Danny flips that one back...

                   DANNY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Here...they came out together.

- BILLY and the girl named LAURA from the office talking
- LAURA kissing BILLY on the cheek as they part

LIONEL compares these to his own and quickly finds the
match.

                   LIONEL
         Match me, Bailey! That’s it. She’s
         the one. Her name was Laura.

                   DANNY
         Laura Rose then maybe. That’s
         Billy Rose. If he’s her father...

                   CONEY
         How the hell you know that?

                   LIONEL
             (ignores him)
         You tailed her?

                   DANNY
         Didn’t have to...she lives right
         next to the club on the corner.
         They musta made me earlier. Soon
         as I got out the car to follow her
         they were on me...

He stops. It really shook him up.

Lionel is excited though. Tony’s paying attention.

                   LIONEL
         I’m telling you this is the
         colored broad Frank was tailing.

                   TONY
         Okay, I’m with you but it’s still

                   LIONEL
         We only just started!

They look at each other for a beat. Tony seems to be
calculating something. His attitude has changed.

                   TONY
         Whatever they want so bad’s gotta
         be worth something, right? I’ll
         tell you what, Freakshow, me and
         Gil’ll stay on the money work,
         keep us floating...you and Danny
         keep sniffing it and we’ll see
         where we get.

                   LIONEL
         I ain’t looking to make a deal
         with these fucks but yeah, okay.

                   CONEY
         Whatever. Hell yeah, I hope those
         mugs poke around again. I’ll have
         something for em.

Danny stares at the floor.

                   TONY
         Whaddya say, D?

                   DANNY
         Fellas, I loved the guy but...I
         mean I’ll handle the cars, hustle
         some domestic shit, you know, but
         I got Linda and...

He can’t say more, doesn’t have to.

                   LIONEL
         Sure, Danny. Right thing.

                   TONY
         No doubt. Get on home, get a steak
         on that eye.

                   CONEY
         C’mon, I’ll give you a lift.

They leave.   Tony and Lionel measure each other.

         get something outta it, for Julia

          For Julia? She can go twist.

          Okay whatever. But don’t go
          holding out on shit with me
          though. We work together, okay
          Lionel? I’ll take anything we can
          scratch up to Mr. Capodanno and
          see what those boys know. We pin
          it on someone, we’ll square
          accounts. My word on it.

Lionel looks at him and nods, then gets up.

                    TONY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
          You wanna get a beer?

                    LIONEL
          Nah, I’m going home. I’ll see ya
          later.

Tony taps him on the shoulder in Lionel’s rhythm, teasing.

                    TONY
          C’mon...let’s get a beer.

Lionel laughs at their old gag but shakes his head.

          Okay but don’t stay up too late,
          Kemosabe.

He exits. Lionel stares at the photo of Laura and as we
push in on her image we CUT TO:


EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - MORNING

A passerby crosses the street in the cold passing through a
small PARK where we find: LIONEL, sipping coffee, twitching
a little and mumbling to himself. He seems happier when
he’s alone, less anxious about his tics. Almost seems to
enjoy turning words over...

                    LIONEL
          Laura Rose. Rose is a rose is a
          rose... Larosa!

And then he sees...LAURA comes out of her building, and
he’s out and moving to follow her...

She walks along in the cold, LIONEL sliding into view
behind her as she makes her way to...

EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - MORNING

Laura heads down the steps...Lionel follows.


INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

Laura boards the train and moves toward an empty seat only
to have a WHITE GUY move his bag onto the seat and stare at
her as the train begins to move. She stares at the man
with no expression and he back at her, daring her. She
turns her back to him leans against a pole, facing directly
at LIONEL, which makes him feel a tic coming that he
comically struggles to suppress. She takes a book from her
bag, some sort of textbook and begins to read, studying and
with this he turns away to release a tic and shout. A WOMAN
WITH A SMALL GIRL reacts to this and moves the child away
from him.

This makes Laura look up over her book for a moment, just
as he turns back around and they meet each others gaze for
just a second. She is composed and lovely.


EXT. FORT GREENE ROW-HOUSE STREET - DAY

Laura walks down a block with Lionel tailing behind.

The neighborhood is edgy, run down, with many boarded up
row houses, uncollected trash and abandoned furnishings.

LAURA goes up a stoop and rings a bell. A BLACK LADY
answers, wary. Laura talks for a moment and removes some
papers from her bag, handing them to the woman. The woman
glances at them, nods and closes the door.

ANOTHER DOOR. She buzzes.

A FACE IN THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW... a wave.

ANOTHER BLACK LADY smiles and hands Laura a sheaf of the
same forms and they talk. Lionel can see that the woman is
indignant and that Laura is TAKING NOTES.

ANOTHER DOOR...this building so bombed out it looks
abandoned but AN OLD BLACK MAN WRAPPED IN A BLANKET OPENS
and this time Laura goes inside.

Lionel glimpses her in the window of the first floor.

LIONEL turns around for a closer look at a row-house behind
him, its front door and second story windows boarded up. He
looks up AT THE FRONT DOOR
                        Pink Revisions                  63.


A SIGN: CONDEMNED: PROPERTY OF: BELMONT DEVELOPERS...

A SOUND SURPRISES HIM and he jumps. To his surprise a
WOMAN WITH TWO KIDS COME OUT from the garden level door
under the stoop. He thought it was abandoned but clearly
there are people squatting here. The WOMAN eyes him
fearfully and hustles her kids away.


EXT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - DAY

TIGHT ON: A PUDDLE OF WATER. Stark trees, fire escapes &
sky reflected in it as LAURA steps across it, rippling the
surface and we tilt up to find LIONEL tailing her.

He watches as she heads for a nondescript
storefront/office: Inwood Residential Services. She goes to
the door and tries it but it’s locked. She turns and faces
the street, clearly exasperated as a CAR pulls up and GABBY
gets out of the driver side. She and Laura confer and
Laura moves to get in the car.

LIONEL spots a cab and hails it but hustles over to the
storefront for a quick look at the sign on the door:

“INWOOD: Your Happy Home is Our Business!”.   HOURS: 9-5

Lionel looks at his watch: 3:21    Should be open. But he
hustles to his cab.


INT.   CAB / EXT. ROADSIDE/OVERPASS - LATE AFTERNOON

The cab pulls over on the shoulder, a distance from the
other car which is pulled up under an overpass, with hazard
lights on.

Lionel’s POV:   the women getting out.

                     LIONEL
           Get out and pop your hood and
           check the oil.

                     CABBIE
           Buddy, come on...

                     LIONEL
           Keep the meter going.

He lifts his binoculars as the cabbie grudgingly complies.

Lionel’s POV:   Gabby shading her eyes, looking up at...
                       Pink Revisions                      64.


LAURA, who has climbed up the slope to the overpass above
and is lowering a tape measure.

We PAN DOWN with the tape measure to Gabby, who records the
height of the overpass.

ON LIONEL: no idea what they’re doing.    SMASH CUT TO:


INT. TOWN HALL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

FACES IN A BUZZING SEATED CROWD as we tilt up to see GABBY
& LAURA, hustling down the center aisle of a packed
auditorium to where their staff members hold seats near a
standing mic.

A group of men at two long tables on stage with mics. Among
the men, THE MAYOR and LIEBERMAN.

LIONEL enters in the back and takes in the scene. He      notes
a guy in the back rows with ‘PRESS’ cards in his hat      band
and slides into a seat behind him. Lionel leans over      his
shoulder and takes out his notebook to play at being      a
fellow reporter

                   LIONEL
         This ain’t my beat. What’s the
         story?

                   REPORTER(JACOB GLEASON)
         Stories of injustice and despair,
         nodding heads and assurances, back
         to business as usual. The
         American Way. Although this one
         could make it interesting.

He indicates GABBY down the aisle conferring with Laura. He
sees Gabby catch sight of: a TALL THIN MAN entering and
taking his seat. Slightly frayed but hawk-like eyes focused
intently on the proceedings. He nods at Gabby. Lionel
deftly slips one of the reporter’s cards from his hatband
and pockets it with practiced ease.

A man onstage kicks things off. WILLIAM LIEBERMAN, one of
Moses Randolph’s sub-bosses.

                   LIEBERMAN
         We’ll commence this public
         comment. State your name, address
         and affiliation please. I’m

         Cindy Fleming, homemaker,
         Yonkers...but formerly East
         Tremont. My family was forced to
         move when they seized our building
         for the Bronx Expressway, and I
         want people to know that--

He cuts her off and speaks to Gabby.

                   LIEBERMAN
         Mrs. Horowitz, you may not hijack
         these proceedings to air out old
         complaints against...

         Gabby Horowitz-Committee on Racial
         Discrimination in Housing- 552
         Clinton Ave, BROOKLYN. I thought
         this was a community hearing?

                   LIEBERMAN
         On housing not highways...

Lionel focuses on him... his VOICE familiar...

                   GABBY
         You’re making the same promises to
         Ft Greene that you made in
         Tremont, where your so-called
         ‘relocation services’ vanished
         into thin air and left families
         like the Flemings utterly adrift.
         People have a right to know what
         they’re in for!

Lionel watches LAURA, slipping Gabby notes.

                   LIEBERMAN
         We are totally committed to the
         welfare of families displaced by
         necessary community improvement
         programs. The past has been
         instructive and our new
         contractors will ensure ALL find
         adequate homes...

As she speaks MOSES RANDOLPH enters late from the side,
tuning in and already impatient. Gabby notes his arrival.

                   GABBY
         This isn’t Long Island you know...
         It’s not just a blank canvas you
         can paint on anywhere you like.
         There are people here, established
         communities.

Randolph shoots an impatient look at the Mayor as he
SITS...The Mayor snaps up obediently...

                   MAYOR
         I hope you all know my name. I’m
         the Mayor, newly residing at
         Gracie Mansion, Manhattan.
             (a few laughs)
         Mrs Horowitz, thank you for work
         and your passion. Surely we can
         all agree that even in a City as
         great as ours we have slums. And
         that a slum is not something to
         romanticize or preserve. You tear
         it down and improve quality of--

                   GABBY
         A neighborhood is not a slum
         because poor people and minorities
         live there, Mr. Mayor. East
         Tremont wasn’t a slum, Third
         Avenue wasn’t a slum and Fort
         Greene is not a slum either, these
         are working class communities.
             (to Randolph)
         Your developers are making it a
         slum!

This brings Randolph lunging forward.

                   RANDOLPH
         That is unsubstantiated,
         unmitigated bunk!

Laura hands her reams of paper which she holds aloft...

                   GABBY
         We have it on paper, we have
         twenty people here tonight and
         scores behind them who can testify
         to a scandalous fraud under
         way...which way would you like it
         first?

Randolph slaps the table with his flat palm violently,
rising out of his chair and overlapping her.

            We are embarking on the most
            ambitious slum clearance program
            in American history Mrs. Horowitz
            and you are gumming it up with
            your molasses! A Niagara of
            molasses!

Suddenly a voice in the audience shouts:

                      VOICE (PAUL)
            MAKE HIM SAY HIS NAME!

Heads turn. Lionel turns. Concern on Gabby’s face.

ANGLE ON:    THE TALL THIN MAN, still seated.

                      MAN (PAUL)
            Name and place of residence, like
            everyone else!

A smattering of applause. The energy is winding Lionel up,
his arm and head jerk spasmodically.

RANDOLPH stares out seeking the source of the voice, eyes
narrowing, glaring. He crosses his arms defiantly. He looks
at the Mayor: “Handle it.”

The MAYOR rises.

                      MAYOR
            Now see here, we all know
            perfectly well who this is... Mo

                      MAN (PAUL)
            Name and residence like everybody
            else!

The audience cheers, really behind it now. Some start to
call out “Make him say it! Make him say it!” Gabby smiles
discreetly. Lionel yelps-

Randolph glares at the Mayor who is starting to sweat.

The crowd chants “Say it!” This is too much for Lionel...

Lieberman nods to some plainclothes SECURITY MEN along the
sides of the room who quickly descend on the MAN. And now
the crowd is on its feet indignant. As they sweep behind
LIONEL with the MAN (Paul) it’s too much him and he leaps
up shrieking

and stand looking at each other in the street.

THE MAN is neatly dressed but his clothes are visibly worn
and shabby. Gaunt and graying, he could be taken for a bum
but his eyes are fierce and sharp, hawkish. We will come to
know him as Paul.

         ‘Hammy Ham House Head’, huh?
         That’s good. I’ll have to remember

         Yeah, that’s the rub in life

He shakes his head and starts to walk away muttering to
himself unintelligibly. Lionel stuffs gum, getting under
control, calls out

         Hey, hold on... tell me something.

gum and nurses a tea...

         The Mayor?! That clown is so green
         he doesn’t even know what he
         doesn’t know yet. He’ll be out the
         door before he even realizes that
         every person he turns to for
         advice is on Randolph’s payroll.

                   LIONEL
         I thought he was Commissioner of
         Parks?

                     PAUL
         He is.

                   LIONEL
         But they called him Construction
         Commissioner.

          PAUL
He’s that too now. They never even
had that position until the Feds
decided to get in the housing
game. It had no defined powers so
he defined ‘em and the Feds
approved and now how much control
of that money has the City got?
Zero. He's got it all. You know
what 'eminent domain' means? If
he says it's a slum, it goes. He
used to have to fight to put his
highways and parks where he
wanted, now he can go anywhere,
tear anything down. He can condemn
a whole section of the city, evict
everyone who lives there and put
up what he wants. And he'll go at
it with an axe.

          LIONEL
SMACKS AXE. He’ll piss too many
people off. He’ll be the most
hated man in NY.

          PAUL
No, they love him! That’s what
makes me so... He flies above it.
They revere him.

          LIONEL
Why?

          PAUL
Because he built the parks! As
long as you're the guy who brings
people parks, you walk with the
angels, you can't lose. The day
Rockaway Beach opened, Moses
Randolph became a folk hero in
this town. But people don't
realize how much he hates them.
“The Hero of the Public Who Hates
People”. There's your headline.
And you know who he hates
especially? (mouths ‘Negroes’)
He's going to seize every
neighborhood in this city that's
not white and turn it over to his
hand-picked private Developers.

          LIONEL
So he’s getting rich. Paid off.

                   PAUL
         Nah, he doesn't want money...he
         wants control and he brokers money
         to get it and guard it. Some men
         aren't satisfied unless they have
         filet mignon. Moses would be happy
         with a pastrami sandwich and
         power.

                   LIONEL
         But you said they just created the
         position...so how...?

                   PAUL
         Oh, christ...Construction-Parks-
         Slums...he’s got 14 appointments!
         That’s all just ink on a glass

Headlights of the waiting CAR light up the front of the
massive stone face and steps of the edifice where Moses
works.

         This town is run by the Borough

INT. ENTRANCE LOBBY OF NY PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Lionel walks through the grand marble lobby.


INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - GRAND READING ROOM - DAY

Lionel walks into the huge room carrying a few huge bound
volumes of newspapers and sits at a table

C.U. - Articles on Moses Randolph. One after another
announcing his accomplishments “West River Park Opens”,
“Hudson Highway”, “A Grand New Beach for Gotham”, “Bronx
Expressway to Liberate Manhattan from Traffic Snarl”.

And effusions of Randolph: “Servant of the People”; “A
Reformer becomes a Builder: ‘to build is to dream’ says
Moses Randolph”

PICTURES: the Triborough Bridge under construction. Moses
smiling and shaking hands with one Mayor after another:
LaGuardia; O’Dwyer; Impellitieri; the new Mayor...

Lionel stops on one: “The Men of the B.A.” - a photo shows
Randolph seated and smiling broadly, surrounded by men in
Suits. Their names captioned: William Lieberman, George
Spaulding, Tom Brooks...

LIONEL FOCUSES ON: William Lieberman. He was the man in
the apartment with Minna. The one in charge...

               (whispered)
           Lieberman. Leering man.

CLOSE ON: another article...”The Private Life of a Public
Man...many of his closest colleagues were surprised to
learn he has a brother.”

PICTURE: a YOUNGER MOSES RANDOLPH and A MAN WHO LOOKS VERY
FAMILIAR...both in black tie attire and smiling...Randolph
leans affectionately on his brother’s shoulder

CAPTION:   “Moses Randolph and Paul Randolph: 1927”

LIONEL’s FACE: recognizing Paul Randolph as the man he
bought dinner for.

                     LIONEL (V.O.)
           That quack in the diner with pork
           chop and peas in his beard was one
           of the most talented engineers of
           his generation. Ivy League. Big
           awards. Walking right next to his
           brother toward being someone
           important. Then sometime right
           after the Crash, just nothing. Like
           he got erased.

He takes out his pen-knife and quietly cuts out this photo
and pockets it.


INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - READING ROOM - LATER

                     LIONEL (V.O.)
           Maybe bad luck. Maybe booze. There
           was all kinds of casualties in
           those days.

TIME CUT: Lionel is handing the box of papers back to a
clerk when he sees the clerk’s paper lying open and a small
HEADLINE:

“BUILDER’S ASSOC TO HONOR Moses Randolph....Plaza Hotel”

Black tie crowd. Working class, union bosses, wives...but

Martini glasses and cigarettes. Union security at the doors
to the Banquet with pins on their lapels.

LIONEL steps out of elevators behind a few late arrivals
who hustle in. Inside beyond the check in table the vast
floor of banquet tables and stage can be seen. Not in a tux
and with no invite he clearly can’t go in the normal way.

A BELL, signals the start of the program and people flow
back in.

Lionel moves across to another door...more to the side, and
slides up to the UNION SECURITY APE. He pulls the edge of
an envelope from inside his jacket...

                   LIONEL
         Gotta get this to Bill Lieberman.

The pea-brain UNION APE knows that name well enough to have
to think...

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         He’s gonna want to see this before
         Randolph sits back down with
         him...

Too many big names to risk it. The guy waves him in and we
begin to hear...

                   SPEAKER
         Ladies and gentlemen, settle
         please and give me your serious
         attention. Our celebration is made

         be called!

LIONEL: slides into a back corner, waiters flowing in and
out past him. He looks left and spots...

JACOB GLEASON, the reporter from the public hearing, in a
tux. He sees Lionel and thumbs his nose in solidarity.
Lionel slides up next to him. Gleason nods, impressed
Lionel got in without a tux.

                   SPEAKER (CONT’D)
         We’d have to look to the Caesars
         and Pharaohs to find men with a
         scale of vision to compare with
         his and yet none of it bears his
         name, so fully does he forbear the
         credit, allowing the people to say
         “we built this ourselves.” A great
         man, a man of history, serving the
         people of this City for over 25
         years...Moses Randolph!

A ERUPTION OF APPLAUSE: As Randolph takes the stage. He
tries to speak and they won’t let him. Shouting as though
for a general after a triumph...

                   LIONEL
         You’d think Patton showed up.

                   GLEASON
         He pays one and half times union
         rate as base on all his jobs.
         They’d pave over their mothers for
         him.

Lionel’s eyes cast around...spotting faces: Lieberman and
the others from the papers.

POV: in the shadows against a column...Paul. Clutching a
large, full envelope. Staring, inscrutable. He snags two
rolls from a passing tray, munches one and stuffs the other
into his suit pocket.

Randolph begins speaking...

                   RANDOLPH
         Tonight, over 300 years since the
         founding of this great city, we
         recommit ourselves to the ancient
         truth...that it is not knowledge
         but Action...Enterprise...which is
         the engine and objective of life.
         Clever men come and go but for
         every dozen men with a bright idea
         there is at most one who can
         execute them.

         I look around this room and I
         don’t see a lot of Bright Boys or
         Goodie Goodie progressives with
         their paralyzing ideals!
              (huge laughter)
         I see men of my tribe. Men who
         know how to Get Things Done! The
         Doers who make this country great.
         And an honor by you is all the
         affirmation or payment I’ll ever
         seek. I thank you and celebrate
         you.

Wild applause...the crowd comes to its feet again.

LIONEL watches: Randolph descends the stage. He’s mobbed by
the bosses high and low...all pressing up to pay respects.
Eventually Moses has to break away.

Lionel’s eyes flick to: Paul...realizing that Randolph
will not be exiting past him, moves urgently to cross the
room toward him. His envelope under his arm, hunting for a
line to cut Randolph off before he leaves. But the crowd
surges and Paul is blocked.

RANDOLPH spots Paul though. They LOCK EYES for just a
second...Randolph frowns, surprised. But something in
Paul’s face makes him pause...something both insistent and
pleading. He sees what Paul is holding and his eyes narrow,
weighing. A small nod...a crack opens that Paul sees and
almost palpably steps toward...But Randolph’s face seems to
say ‘Not here.’ LIEBERMAN whispers something to him and
with a final look at Paul he turns and is led out the side
exit.

Paul’s jaw clenches but his eyes are alight and he hustles
for an exit...and LIONEL FOLLOWS...


EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE AVENUE - NIGHT

LIONEL follows Paul and then peeks around a corner to find
Paul pacing in the dark along a nice apartment building,
near the edge of the light from the canopied doorway. He’s
waiting, not hiding.

THE BIG BLACK CAR pulls up...Paul straightens his hat and
smooths his jacket as.....RANDOLPH GETS OUT.

Paul steps out of the dark, blocking the path to the
doorway. RANDOLPH stops and they stand facing each other in
a BEAM OF LIGHT FROM THE DOORWAY.

Lionel leans around the corner to listen and we can see it
playing out behind Lionel like a shadow play that we hear
bits of.

                    RANDOLPH
          You finished it.

                    PAUL
          Best work I’ve ever done. A total
          modernization of the state’s
          electrical grid. And it’s a scale
          only you can get done.

Randolph weighs this. Takes it and moves inside.

                    RANDOLPH
          Clean yourself up for Chrissake...

                    PAUL
          With what!?

                    RANDOLPH
          Not fucking word out of you about
          any of that! Bring that up to me
          ever again I’ll close you out...

                     PAUL
          Close me out?! I’m so far out I’m
          doing piece work for kids fresh out
          of school!

                    RANDOLPH
          Whip up a crowd against me like
          that ever again and I’ll take your
          big idea and throw it on the scrap
          heap! That what you want?

          No! NO!! Alright, I’m sorry. None
          of that matters. Just...read it

              (beat)
          I’ll read it.

He turns and goes inside. Paul stands, staring into the
light after his brother, his thin coat blowing around him
but his head up high. For a moment he seems straightened
up by hope. Then he turns and walks into the dark.

          never had family so I never could

LIONEL hustling through the crowd in the cold.

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          My crazy brain was telling me to
          pull on that thread, but whatever
          Frank found, he found it following
          the girl. So I just kept chasing

INT. LIONEL’S CAR #2/EXT. FORT GREENE STREET/BROWNSTONES

Lionel drives down a street looking for an address. Even
more desolate and run down than the first place he followed
Laura, a once happy lower-middle class neighborhood of
brownstones, now ravaged, boarded up windows everywhere. A
tense atmosphere...

Suddenly he spots LAURA coming down a stoop with a young
BLACK MAN. He is talking fast, ANGRY. Lionel parks and
watches in the rear view mirror as they go up into another
dilapidated brownstone.

Lionel gets out and approaches the stoop. Spies that the
ground floor door under the stoop is swinging open. Knocks,
waits, looks around...and enters into...


INT. DILAPIDATED BROWNSTONE - DAY

Darker inside...gloomy. He can hear voices upstairs.
Daylight cutting through in hard shafts. We can see that
this was a nice middle class home, but it looks like it’s
been strip-mined. An empty space where the fridge should
be, fixtures ripped away, nice walls cut open to remove
sections of copper pipe, now dripping.

Lionel pokes into a bathroom and clicks the light on...it
still works, dimly sputtering. Nice tiles broken to get at
pipes, sink fixtures gone.

He looks at himself in the mirror, watching impassively as
his own head TWITCHES and SPASMS mildly.

inside only to find...

POV: he’s looking clear into the next room. The wall
behind the mirror has been opened and pipes stripped out.
Then...

A BLACK GUY STEPS INTO THE FRAME OUT OF NOWHERE, looking at
Lionel who jolts and with a yelp steps back into...

The ANGRY GUY LAURA was with, now blocking the door.

         the house will be condemned. It’s
         not true but that scares out about
         half and they sell for cheap. Then
         they come in and take the nice old
         family homes and chop em into 4
         and rent em up. Folks who don’t
         leave they harass... turn the heat
         off, come in to do repairs and
         steal copper pipe instead. They
         re-possessed all the
         refrigerators, even if people
         bought them themselves, then
         resold them out of shopfronts next
         neighborhood over. City sold em
         property worth $15 million for
         $500,000 to take the ‘risk’ of
         having to build the Federal
         projects. They haven’t even

         making it up like some Negro
         propaganda conspiracy...

                   LIONEL
             (stopping her)
         No, no. Look I got a condition, I
         say funny things sometimes but I’m
         not trying to be funny, okay? I’m
         listening. Where’s everybody go?

         Mostly just disappear. Fade away.
         Go into real slums or other
         neighborhoods. Some are renting a
         room in a house they used to own.
         200,000 in 2 years just from this
         part of Brooklyn. Mostly Negro.
         Latino.

                    LIONEL
          But Horowitz said they did it in
          Tremont too.

                    LAURA
          Yeah they did it to a few Jews too
          but not systematic like this. You
          know how many parks have been
          built in this city since he’s been
          Commissioner? 255. How many of
          those in Harlem you think? 1.
          You build a new beach for the
          ‘people’, but the ones with no
          cars, the poor ones, the black and
          brown ones?...how are they going
          get to the parks and beaches?
          Public bus. Guess how high they
          just built the overpasses on the
          new parkway? One foot too low for
          a bus to clear.

Lionel gives an incredulous look...

                    LAURA (CONT’D)
          Look forget whether it’s
          discrimination...the Federal
          government and the City are being
          scammed! There’s supposed to be
          relocation services, company’s got
          a $2 million dollar contract to
          handle it but nobody even answers
          the phone. Call the city, they say
          these folks are on the list for
          the new public housing. But then
          it never gets built.

They have come to Lionel’s car.   He stops.

                    LIONEL
          You know more’n any secretary I
          ever met.

                    LAURA
              (indignant)
          Secretary? Who told you that? I’ve
          got a law degree you know? I’ll
          pass the Bar first time I sit too.

He’s staring at her now...she’s beautiful to him. She
catches it and blushes...then sharpens her look,
suspicious.

         How are you gonna write about it
         all when you don’t even take a
         note?

                   LIONEL
         “2 million for relocation; bridges
         a foot too low for buses; 1 out of
         255 parks; $15 mil for $500k;
         200,000 people in Ft Greene
         alone”. I never forget anything,
         believe me. Not a single word.

She nods, impressed. He’s strange but he really looks at
her and listens. He can’t help it and has to tap her twice
on the shoulder.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Sorry...I really can’t help it.

                   LAURA
             (softens)
         It’s okay. Just write about it,
         okay? What happens to poor people
         in this city wasn’t news yesterday
         and it won’t be tomorrow. But
         you’d think somebody’d care what
         happens to Brooklyn. It’s only the
         biggest city on Earth.

She sighs and looks away.

                   LIONEL
         Where do you live?

                   LAURA

                   LIONEL
         I can give you a ride. Trains’ll
         be mobbed.

That surprises her but she looks at him and then nods.

They don’t say much of anything at all but some faster
‘bop’ on the radio activates his tics which he tries to
hide which only makes it worse.

                    LIONEL
          Bebop, Bailey in the Metropolitan
          BOPera House! Shit. Sorry.

                    LAURA
          Don’t be sorry, it’s kinda funny.

                    LIONEL
          Yeah. Hang around a little longer.

She can see that it weighs on him. Notices the twitching
now

                    LAURA
          What is all that anyway?

                    LIONEL
          I don’t know. It’s like a piece of
          my head split off and got a life
          of its own but then decided to
          keep joyriding me for kicks. Kicks
          and ticks! Licks and ticks! Sorry.
          It’s like living with a fucking
          anarchist. But the flip side is
          its gotta have everything in its
          right place, everything has to
          sound just right or it’ll tie me
          into knots until I fix it. Like
          I’m talking to you but that piece
          of my head? It’s worrying that the
          bills in my wallet aren’t all
          facing the same direction. It’s
          not fair.

                    LAURA
          Hey, I guess we all got our daily
          battles, right?

This makes him stop and take her in, remembers what she must
deal with.

                    LIONEL
          Yeah, fair enough.   Kiss her face
          all night, Bailey!

He’s mortified by that one but she laughs hard...

                    LIONEL (CONT’D)
          I really am sorry, I don’t mean
          nothing by it

         It’s alright. Really it’s alright

She changes the music to a cool ballad and they drive on,
crossing the bridge into Manhattan and on up to Harlem as
night falls.


EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB/INT. MYSTERY CAR - NIGHT

POV: Someone in a car is watching them park


INT. LIONEL’S CAR/EXT. KING ROOSTER - CONTINUOUS

The exterior of the little club is hopping. People hustling
inside, some folks having a smoke. A cool little kid in a
full suit and hat on the sidewalk acting like a doorman
waves at Laura through the window. Laura points to the
building next to the club

                   LAURA
         This is me.

                   LIONEL
         That must keep you up nights.

                   LAURA
         My father owns this place. I grew
         up falling asleep in the back of
         clubs.

                   LIONEL
         Pretty hopping on a Monday night.

                   LAURA
         Yeah, hottest band in the world,
         all week. I gotta check on one or
         two things, but...look, are you
         really interested...in what I was
         telling you?

                   LIONEL
         I came looking for you didn’t I?

                   LAURA
         If you want to come in I can give
         you a lot more.

He looks at the club: it’s exactly the kind of scene that
spells disaster for him usually. She smiles

                   LAURA (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         You can’t exactly disturb the
         peace in a small club with a hot
         band.

She indicates ‘C’mon’. He gives in and they get out into..


INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

This place is for real. No mid-town mainstream joint. A lot
of energy...buzz of anticipation over who’s playing...a few
white Beat kids from Columbia trying to blend in...

Almost immediately it starts to infect Lionel. His head
jerks and he pops gum right away...Laura points him at a
table against the wall and boots two young cats out of it
with one look. She heads for the end of the bar and the
cash register, bringing the BARTENDER to her with a look.
She clearly has the run of the place...

As Lionel sits he takes it all in...sees eyes on him. Cocks
Minna’s hat back and watches as a WHITE KID comes up
nervously to the TRUMPET PLAYER having a drink before his
band’s set with his FRENCH GIRLFRIEND and his Piano player.

                   BEATNIK
         Excuse me, sir...?

The TRUMPET PLAYER and his friend flick a look up.

                   BEATNIK (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Sorry...I’m a trumpet player too
         and I really admire your
         tremolo...I just wondered how you
         developed that?

                   TRUMPET
         Suckin’ off little white boys like
         you. Get the fuck outta here...

The TRUMPET PLAYER turns back to his laughing friend,
shaking his head.

                   LIONEL
         SO WHAT, Whitey White Suck Stick!

This makes the TRUMPET PLAYER turn in surprise laughing...

                   TRUMPET
         Whitey White Suck stick! ‘So what’
         is right...

LIONEL’S POV: Laura drilling the BARTENDER over something
to do with the register count. He’s giving her back talk
and she’s not having it. She SLAPS THE BAR HARD TWICE,
shutting him up and dresses him down. The TRUMPET PLAYER
laughs at this and wags his finger at the bartender then
takes the stage.

                   TRUMPET (CONT’D)
         How y’all doing tonight? It’s good
         to be home. We been traveling the
         world, learning new languages. With
         new language comes new ideas. We
         gonna try a few of them on y’all
         tonight. So strap in.

Lionel gets up and moves to the end of the bar to get a
drink, watching her and meeting her eye...she starts
walking toward him and SMILES and it makes things slow down
for a second...and then right as she takes the stool next
to him...the MUSIC kicks in...

A HARD FAST SNARE RIFF: and then it’s ON.

It hits Lionel like a shot and he WHOOPS loud...but so does
half the joint...and for once he doesn’t seem so weird.

Laura laughs and we JUMP CUT INTO:


INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

A SEQUENCE: Lionel is getting drunk and starting to get
totally flipped out on the HARD JAZZ, ticcing and shouting
with abandon, self-consciousness gone because it seems to
egg on the band...

BILLY ROSE: in the door. A young dude leaning in to whisper
to him but Billy’s eyes are LOCKED ON--

LIONEL and LAURA, leaning together drinking and laughing.

BILLY whispering back to the guy and indicating...

Suddenly the guy is at Laura’s elbow pulling on her and
whispering. Lionel is too into the music to notice...he’s
on his feet and jerking spasmodically...but LAURA is having
none of it. She knows this guy and is telling him to beat
it.

SONG ENDS to clapping and shouts. LIONEL hooting and
whistling. THE TRUMPET PLAYER is picking up the vibe off
Laura and intervenes on the mic....

          Uh oh, there’s my favorite baby
          girl, looking pretty as a Rose...

Everybody looks over and this makes the GUY back off Laura,
who shakes his hand off her arm hard.

BILLY, his eyes fierce on Lionel and jaw tight.

LAURA GRABS a clueless LIONEL and pulls him on the floor to
dance...TRUMPET PLAYER gets her cue...

                    TRUMPET (cont’d) (CONT’D)
          This one’s for you Laura...

He slides into the SLOW SAD THEME WE HEARD AFTER MINNA
DIED...and Laura steps up to Lionel, other couples standing
with them. LIONEL is immediately uncomfortable with being
up in front of people in the suddenly intimate and quiet
moment. He starts to twitch and whispers to her urgently

                    LIONEL
          This isn’t a good idea. I don’t
          think I can do this.

LAURA’s focus comes back to him and she realizes he’s in
real distress. She smiles as if to say ‘It’s okay’ but his
twitches and suppresses a shout. She instinctively touches
the back of his neck sympathetically. To his surprise, her
touch settles him, he breathes easier and dances with her,
holding still...

BILLY whispers urgently, angry to two more YOUNG CATS who
nod.

They dance slow until the song ends...it can’t last
forever.

The crowd claps as Lionel stares at her not wanting to let
go but she’s seeing something over his shoulder and she
touches his face a second and then, annoyed, breaks away...

                    TRUMPET
          Don’t get too cozy. That was your
          last break.

He snaps and the band counts off into the hot chaotic “Jump
Monk”.

looming over him. One gives him a good kick to the ribs.

LIONEL’S on the ground looking up, woozy and short of
breath.

BILLY’S THERE...looking down on him. Billy grabs him up by
the collar, USING ONLY HIS LEFT ARM...THE RIGHT HANGING
LIMP.

This pisses Billy off even more...He hauls Lionel up harder
with his one powerful arm.

prepping a smoke of something...something more than weed.

          happened. We had a party. Different
          mix of people than the usual. The
          ‘etrange melange’ she calls it.

Lionel’s eyes flick to the kitchen where the French
girlfriend is making coffee.

         my head. The music really set it
         off. I’m sorry.

                   TRUMPET
         Don’t be sorry. You got a head just
         like mine. Always boiling over,
         turning things around. That’s
         music...runs you more’n you run it
         when it gets up in you.

         Some people call it a gift but
         it’s a brain affliction just the
         same.

                   LIONEL
         Yeah, but I just twitch and shout.
         At least you got a horn to push it
         through, make it sound pretty.

                   TRUMPET
         Yeah but there’s a lotta other
         hours in the day though, you know
         what I’m sayin’? Too many!

He tokes. Lionel nods and they let that understanding sit
between them. Lionel stands and scribbles a number on a
matchbook.

                   LIONEL
         Thanks for helping me out. You
         ever need a ride anywhere or help
         with anything, give me a call.

TRUMPET PLAYER takes it and nods as Lionel exits.


EXT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - DAY

Lionel is heading across the street to the steps when he
sees...Gabby Horowitz...coming down them.

He stops...

                   LIONEL
         Mrs. Horowitz...?

She looks up...he extends his hand.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Jacob Gleason, reporter with the
         Post...

She looks at him quizzically

                   GABBY
         I know Jake Gleason, you’re not...

Caught, he switches it up mid-sentence...

                   LIONEL
         Sorry, Jake, brought me to the
         Hamilton Housing hearing.

                   LIONEL (CONT'D)
         I’m a new writer for the Times and
         I’m very interested in this story.

She shakes his hand...not totally convinced yet.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         I met your secr-- your aide, Laura
         Rose. Rose is a rose! She gave me
         a very illuminating tour of what’s
         going on in Ft. Greene. I wanted
         to follow up with her...

This piques Gabby’s interest...

                   GABBY
         Really. I thought being the press
         office for the Borough Authority
         was more the business of the Times
         than exposing them. Seeing as
         your publisher is an investor in
         the bank that gets to float the
         Authority’s bonds at preferred
         rates.

Lionel is flummoxed. Smiles big...

                   LIONEL
         I’m not saying I can get it A-1
         but if I don’t do the legwork, I
         can’t try can I?

This seems to impress her enough...

                   GABBY
         Well, someone’s going to win a
         Pulitzer off Title 1, so maybe
         it’ll be you.

                   LIONEL
         IF!

                   GABBY
         Yes, it’s a big ‘if’. Laura’s gone
         ahead to the protest, you can come
         with me if you want.

She looks at him and as they walk to the curb we CUT TO:


EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

ON THE CURB: GABBY’S CAR pulls up to where Laura and
another staff member stand waiting. Gabby jumps out and
Laura grabs her hand

                   GABBY
         I brought the New York Times!

But they leave Lionel behind and we rush with them across
and through the center of the Arch, revealing REFORMER #2
speaking to the crowd of a large protest. Hundreds have
gathered: placards, real citizens of every stripe out in
force, energized and angry. The Reformer is warming up the
crowd for Gabby.

                   REFORMER #2
         I want you to give it up for our
         next speaker. She wears granny
         glasses but don’t be fooled! She
         is a PIT BULL for the people! And
         she taught me more about fighting
         the good fight than anyone. Let’s
         not mince words because the moment
         we are living in calls for naming
         things as they are! This is not a
         program of slum removal, it is a
         program of Negro removal! Now
         let’s hear from Gabby Horowitz!

The crowd takes up a chant: ‘Relocate Randolph!’

CLOSE ON: Lionel sliding into a spot at the back of the
crowd. He scans the scene...

LIONEL POV: Laura handing Gabby notes as she gets ready;
some men around the edges who seem to be photographing the
crowd; and Paul: standing back in the fringes, clapping as
Gabby steps up to the podium to cheers

                   GABBY
         What is a City? Is it a place
         where people slave for the Lords
         of steel and concrete? A corral
         for the Druids of Finance to
         fleece mankind in? NO! The City is
         its people, it is its Communities!
         The City is built to serve US!

Lionel’s gaze shifts past her to: THE BIG BLACK BA-1 CAR:
sliding innocuously in to park on the curb beyond the
trees.

                   GABBY (cont’d) (CONT’D)

The CROWD ROARS...and we CUT TO:


INT. MOSES’S BLACK CAR/EXT. WASHINGTON SQ PARK - SAME

Lieberman and Moses Randolph sit in the back seat, watching
as they talk...

                   LIEBERMAN
         We may have an issue with our
         friend from Brooklyn.

                   RANDOLPH
         How so?

                   LIEBERMAN
         He’s not here for this meshugas,
         he’s not that brave...but he still
         might not go along with the vote.
         Says his constituency is up in
         arms...

                   RANDOLPH
         We made him Borough President, we
         put him on the Board of Estimate.
         We're his constituency. Don't tell
         me he won't go along...

He pulls a file out of the valise the Aide gave him and
hands it over to Lieberman, casually as a man hands over a
Kleenex.

                   RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Show him that the day before the
         vote. He’ll go along. He’s a
         louse.

RANDOLPH POV: from inside the car we can see that the crowd
has hoisted an effigy of a man with a sign saying “Moses
Randolph” hung on its neck and they are setting it to
flame.

                    RANDOLPH (CONT’D)
          Let’s go have lunch.


EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER

The protest is over, Lionel pushes through crowd by the
marble arch...

                     LAURA (O.S.)
          Jake!   Hey Jake!!

She enters chasing him and grabs his arm...he turns

                    LIONEL
          Ah the disappearing lady...

                    LAURA
          I’m so sorry...I own you an
          explanation..

                    LIONEL
          Nah, you don’t owe me nothing. I’m
          used to it.

                    LAURA
          No I want to explain.

From O.S., Gabby yells for her

                    LIONEL
          You gotta go.

                    LAURA
          I’ll be up at the club tonight
          later. Meet me there.

                    LIONEL
          I’ll see if I can

                     LAURA
          Come.

Gabby calls again and she hustles off, Lionel watches her a
beat. Then catches sight of someone and rushes out after...

PAUL: shambling away, pulling up his thin coat against the
cold. Lionel hustles up from behind to catch up with him.

Paul perceives him and, after a moment of fear, realizes
who it is... (as before Paul’s speech is like a fire-hose,
a manic blitz of information)

                   PAUL
         The reporter who never reports...

                   LIONEL
         I’m still putting the pieces
         together.

                   PAUL
         You need me to write it for you?
         Jeez you’re not too ambitious are
         you? Okay here’s your next
         headline: “New Expressway Will be
         the World’s Biggest Parking Lot.”

                   LIONEL
         Why?

                   PAUL
         Because cars are a cancer and
         roads make them metastasize not
         shrink. We need trains but he’s
         killing the trains.

                   LIONEL
         Why?

                   PAUL
         Always with the ‘why?’ Because he
         doesn’t control the revenue from
         trains, he controls the tolls on
         bridges and roads. Borough
         Authority. You know what an
         Authority is? Neither did anybody
         else. He invented it. A 4th branch
         of government...a shadow branch...
         with independent revenue that is
         the only reliable financing for
         public works, all controlled by
         him meaning he controls everything
         and yet nobody ever voted for him
         and they can’t vote him out.

                   LIONEL
         What could stop him?

                   PAUL
         Almost nothing. And he’s more
         dangerous now than ever.

         Why now?

                   PAUL
         Because the Board of Estimate votes
         on his highway and slum clearance
         plans this week! So he’s breaking
         out all his dirt on people.
         Bullying everyone into submission.
             (stops and turns)
         He is the most powerful person in
         the history of this City! He is a
         autocratic Caesar. And nobody
         realizes it. They’re all walking
         around calm as Hindu cows,
         thinking they live in a Democracy
         so what could go wrong?. Now are
         you going to write it or what?!

                   LIONEL
         If you’ve got the goods why don’t
         you take him down?

                   PAUL
             (snapping)
         ‘Cause it can’t be me!

                   LIONEL
         Cause you’re his brother?

This is the first thing that stops Paul’s torrent and makes
him look stricken and vulnerable...

                   PAUL
         ‘Cause I’ve still got dreams.
         That’s why. Dreams I’m this close
         to realizing. My contribution to
         society...my legacy! I won’t risk
         it.
             (whispering - paranoid)
         Okay here, look at Belmont
         Developers and Inwood Residential.

                   LIONEL
         What’s that?

                   PAUL
             (sharp-resentful)
         Christ, I’m giving you the goods!
         A map to the scoop of the
         decade...Do your own damn job! Do

And with that he’s leaving...waving off Lionel and
muttering to himself...and we CUT TO:


INT. THE NEW YORK HALL OF RECORDS - CLERK’S DESK - LATER
SAME DAY

A CLERK leads Lionel to an open table where he puts down a
big metal file of records...Lionel moves to slide it toward
a chair but the Clerk stops him.

          Oh sorry, I’ll need your name and
          social security number.

                    LIONEL

them.

CLOSE ON: documents of incorporation for “Belmont

He double checks it in disbelief:

He tries to muffle it but he looks up and the CLERK is
scowling at him and we CUT TO:


EXT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - NIGHT

The early evening dark of winter.   LIONEL hustles to the
door.


INT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - CONTINUOUS

A tiny single room with a single reception desk. Absurdly
spare. A LONE SECRETARY who looks up from a book.

                   SECRETARY
         May I help you?

                   SECRETARY

         there.

She points again at an even bigger pile...two or three
boxes of completed forms against a wall.

                   LIONEL
         So they have you running this whole
         operation all by yourself, do they?

She smiles flirtatiously and drops her book revealing a
tight pink sweater and Vargas girl rack...

          evening.

He leaves. Disappointed she watches him go.


EXT. INWOOD RESIDENTIAL SERVICES - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Lionel watches as... THE SECRETARY opens the door, braces
it open, hauls out a box, closes the door and locks it.
She then hefts the box, walks over to a bunch of trash cans
and lifts the metal lid and tips the box in. She dusts her
hands and walks off for the night.

LIONEL HUSTLES ACROSS THE STREET, straight to the cans.

He opens the lid and the clang of it echoes in the dark. He
reaches in and pulls up...a handful of the forms. He
seizes a few to hold up into the light and examine when the
SCRAPE OF A SHOE IN GRAVEL makes him turn into...

The FLASH of movement of an ARM....THONK.

LIONEL’s POV: the world spins upward as he goes down and
we can hear him groan...backlit by the street lamp, figure
in a hat leans down...LOU bending over him, the leather sap
still in his hand.

                    LOU
          People’s trash remains private
          property until its collected.
          Anybody ever tell you that?

almost out of frame...

LOU’s face, as the Giant burns the evidence.

          Keep sticking your nose in
          people’s trash and we’ll be seeing
          each other again.

They step out of frame and the streetlight FLARES in our
eyes and we hear their footsteps start away when...

LOU leans in again...closer

         Jeez, I was told to go easy and I
         did. But now you made me go and

HIS FOOT rises up and comes down into our face with a nasty
CRACKING THUD.

LIONEL is holding an ice bag against the back of his head
and has a bruise starting to color under one eye. He’s
going over it all with TONY...CONEY and DANNY listen and
try to follow.

         Don’t pay no attention to him.
         Look, people cut deals with the
         pols for contracts, what else is
         new? Kicking up the chain, it’s
         the nature of things...

                   LIONEL
         They’re not making deals with
         politicians, they’re making deals
         with themselves! They own the
         companies they’re giving contracts
         to! It ain’t kickbacks, it’s Grand
         Larceny... Land a Farce on me!

Danny pulls a joint out and starts it up hands it to Lionel
who goes ahead and takes a deep pull.

         Minna said this was the biggest
         gravy train of the century and it

         was Frank mixed up in it?

         Every one of the officers of the
         Borough Authority is gonna make
         millions on this deal. But none of
         it ties to him.

          The Parks Commissioner?

                    LIONEL
          It’s all about him. The girl has
          the line on the scam, she’s been
          digging into those companies for
          Horowitz. I think she found
          something that ties Randolph right
          to the money. Frank was following
          her and he figured it out and he
          took it in to Lieberman and his
          goons and showed em he had a
          signature. I’m telling you, Frank
          had something that nails Randolph.

The guys look unsure.

                    LIONEL (CONT’D)
          C’mon! Where did we lose em? On
          the Borough Bridge, for chrissake!
          They had a pass! Those guys were
          BA! The Borough Authority killed
          Frank!

Worked up and exhausted, he sucks hard on the joint. Tony
is listening very attentively to him...

                    TONY
          Alright...alright, calm down.
          Fuckin’ Lionel...I think you’re on
          the sniff. I do. But what’s the
          angle on the guy at the club? Her
          father. What was Frank doing
          talking to him?

                    LIONEL
          I got no idea...part makes no
          sense to me. But he knows
          something.

Tony nods.

                     TONY
          Go home.   Let me do some calling
          around.

Lionel looks at him...confused...getting high...

         Will you just trust me and let me
         run with it?

Lionel doesn’t know what that means but he’s too stoned now
to sort it. He nods.


INT. LIONEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lionel enters, stoned and sore.

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         Frank was the only person I knew
         who thought the way we won the war
         was gonna cause us problems. He
         said after the Crash we were
         digging ourselves out by taking
         care of each other. But now that
         we’d seen what we could do with our
         brute strength, there was no going
         back. He said ‘From here on out,
         the game’s gonna be about Power,
         from top to bottom.’

TIGHT ON: Minna’s hat, as he hangs it on the wall next to
his own

He flops on the bed and the cat appears and he strokes it.
He has just closed his eyes when the RINGING PHONE JOLTS
HIM LIKE A SHOCK. He answers it...

         Yeah. Okay. So what?

                   BILLY’S VOICE
         Sorry for roughing you up. Thought
         you was one of them BA goons.

Sounds of Billy doing something....

                   BILLY’S VOICE (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         We can’t talk about it like this.
         It ain’t safe. Meet me up at the
         club. Park up the block and come
         in the back, I’ll let you in
         there.

                      BILLY’S VOICE
         Yeah now!

CLICK. Lionel looks at the phone a beat. Then he sits up
and goes to a desk drawer and opens it and pulls out
MINNA’s AUTOMATIC PISTOL. He drops the mag out and checks
it and shoves it back in and on the SNAP we...CUT TO:


EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

Lionel pauses at the opening of the alley, checks around
him when...BANG!...a muffled report snaps his head around.
Was that a shot? Hard to tell where it came from.

Lionel walks cautiously down the alley, past trash cans
where Billy yelled at him, reaching the back door of the
club. He prods the door open slowly with his foot.

                   LIONEL
             (calls quietly)
         Billy?

SOUNDS OF VOICES CURSING SOFTLY, FEET MOVING. He cautiously
enters the back door...

INT. THE KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Over Lionel’s shoulder as he works his way into the club by
the back hall and emerges into the back of the stage
revealing...

THE FIGURE OF BILLY SITTING IN A CHAIR ON THE BANDSTAND,
the light from the street silhouetting him

                     LIONEL
         Billy...?    You hear that?

LIONEL STOPS COLD...BILLY is holding a gun down by his side
with SMOKE STILL CURLING FROM THE BARREL. He seems to be
staring forward toward the front where the door is creaking
open as though someone has left fast...but something is
odd...

And then as Lionel comes around him he can see...

BILLY ROSE IS DEAD IN THE CHAIR...blood running down his
white shirt from a gunshot wound through the chest and a
belt tied around his chest to hold himself up. A suicide?

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Ah shit...

Then he stops cold, hairs on his neck rising...THE GUN IS
HANGING IN BILLY’S USELESS RIGHT HAND.

LIONEL RIPS HIS GUN OUT, SPINS TOWARD THE FRONT.

SOUND OF A CAR STARTING ON THE STREET. He hustles to the
front cubicle and bursts out onto...


EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

LIONEL BURSTS ONTO THE STREET in time to see...a BLACK CAR
turning the corner, smooth and quiet...spooky...and gone.


EXT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT - A BIT LATER

Cop cars...patrolmen guarding the door. A DETECTIVE is
interviewing Lionel...not your average 3rd Class
Dick...this guy has rank...

         I already told you, I didn’t just
         find him...I heard it happen. He
         didn’t shoot himself...SHOOT MY
         SHIT, BAILEY!... Somebody shot him
         and set it up to look like he
         punched out. I heard ‘em leave.

                   DETECTIVE
         Uh huh. Powder burn on his shirt.
         Point blank. Neighbors telling us
         he had money problems...Seems
         pretty straightforward, friend.

                   LIONEL
         The gun’s in his right hand.

                   DETECTIVE
         So.

                   LIONEL
         He’s got a dead right arm, ace.
         War wound. He can’t lift a Zippo
         with it let alone a .38. You wanna
         show me how he shot himself in the
         heart with his left hand and then
         handed it off to his right before
         he punched out?

         Guy went out in his own joint,
         center stage with the lights and
         all. Gotta give him credit. I
         respect his style.

THE BODY IS BEING BROUGHT OUT ON A STRETCHER.

Lionel glances at the COP, something not right...

         They usually put Division dicks on

         Oh no...Oh NOOOOO!

She pushes past him to Billy’s body, distraught.

WIDE: the sad tableau of her bent over BILLY’S BODY with
Lionel hanging behind...and music floats in as we CUT TO:


INT. LAURA’S HALLWAY / APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT

He escorts her up the stairs of the tenement apartment to
her door. She inserts the key but stops with her hand on
it. Her head falls and she starts weeping. He reaches down
gently and pulls her hand off the key, turns it himself and
opens the door.

She stands in the doorway with tears falling silently down
her face.

                   LAURA
         I can’t think of the last time I
         saw him smile...But...why would he
         do that...to himself...?

Her voice breaks...he lifts her face up...

                   LIONEL
         He didn’t. Someone wanted it to
         look that way.

She shakes her head...

                   LAURA
         Man was angry as long as I can
         remember. But nobody hated him
         like that...nobody.

He reflexively touches her shoulder three times in a row.
She accepts it...too upset to care.

She nods and we...FADE TO:


INT. LAURA’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

WIDE ON THE ROOM: In the spill of morning light, Laura is
asleep on her side on the bed, facing us, with Lionel’s
coat draped over her. Lionel has fallen asleep in his
clothes, beside her, awkwardly against the headboard.

TWO SHOT ON THE BED: as Laura wakes with a sharp inhale and
turns over staring at the ceiling, processing that it’s all
real, numb. Realizing Lionel is still there, she sits up
slightly next to him...Her movement brings him awake and he’s
immediately uncomfortable about having fallen asleep next to
her.

                    LIONEL
          IF! Ah, sorry... I don’t know what
          happened...didn’t mean to fall
          asleep. Sorry.

                    LAURA
          It’s okay...I appreciate you
          staying.

                    LIONEL
          Listen, I know how you’re feeling,
          I really do. Pretty soon you’re
          gonna hear his voice in your head
          telling you to pull yourself
          together and get moving. And when
          you do, you’ll feel him smiling
          again.

This triggers her and she weeps. He sits with it until she
recovers.

                    LAURA
          Why you being so nice to me?

          Cause I think you’re a good person.
          You actually care about what
          happens to other people. And you
          try to make a difference. That’s a
          good way to be.

                    LAURA
          You’re sweet.

She takes his hand, winds her fingers into his.

                    LIONEL
          Well, that isn’t how most people
          describe me when they meet me, but
          I’m glad if you think so. IF!

          He never called me by my name. He
          called me “Brooklyn”. He’d say
          ‘Look at you, Motherless Brooklyn.
          Got no one looking out for you.’

                    LAURA
          We all need someone looking out
          for us.

She kisses him softly, lingering a second. She rolls off
the bed and out of frame...He watches her go, affected by
her.

ANGLE ON: a PHOTO IN A FRAME on the shelf near the bed...A
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a 20’s-style dress, smiling.
Her skin very dark, eyes white and shining...happy. Holding
a LITTLE BABY, wrapped up.

         I need to make arrangements, a
         funeral...

                   LIONEL
         All that can wait cause if I’m
         right the Coroner’s office won’t
         release the body to you yet. Get
         one of the guys from the club to
         take you down there. Then stay
         around people you know until I
         come and get you, alright?

She nods, fearful.

THE SIZZLE AND POP OF AN EDGY RIFF COMES UP AND WE CUT TO:


EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING

Lionel exits her building and immediately LARGE MEN ARE ON
EITHER SIDE OF HIM, plucking the GUN from his holster
before he can even make a move, MOVING HIM TOWARD A CAR.
NOT COPS...but they have that familiar PIN on their
lapels...and, like MINNA on the day he was killed, Lionel
is pushed INTO A BLACK CAR AND AWAY IT GOES...as we CUT TO:


EXT. BOROUGH AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

LIONEL is escorted in.


INT BOROUGH AUTHORITY HEADQUARTERS - WAITING ROOM - CONT

Lionel stands in the antechamber of an office off a grand
lobby...every detail says that this is the SEAT of POWER.

The two MUSCLES IN SUITS stand totally silent blocking the
exit. Not threatening...just there. Impassive.

THE INNER DOOR OPENS REVEALING: William Lieberman.

He looks at Lionel with the cold scrutiny of a practiced
strategist, sizing him up. Then he nods and opens the door
wider nodding Lionel into...


INT. MOSES RANDOLPH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Big. A commanding view of the East River on both sides,
flowing around the island on which they sit, under the
Triborough Bridge which can be seen looming above as well.
The office of a kingpin...

In the center is a massive table with a model of the whole
of New York’s FIVE BOROUGHS...the pieces all movable.
Bridges and elevated highways and huge apartment towers all
placed...infrastructure that will not exist for more than a
decade...a glimpse of New York City in the future...

...and on the other end of the room, waiting by his desk
with his arms crossed is Moses Randolph.

He looks up as Lionel enters, gestures that he come join
him by the MODEL OF THE CITY.

Without a word, Lieberman slides to a chair on the
periphery and lights a cigarette, which he smokes through
the scene, languid and cool.

RANDOLPH stands regarding Lionel who nervously hides his
small tics in fake adjustments of his neck such...

                   RANDOLPH
         You know who I am?

                   LIONEL
         I been asking around about that
         but everybody seems to have a
         different answer.

RANDOLPH laughs loud and sharp.

                   RANDOLPH
         Ha! Spoken like a true snoop!

His loud laugh makes Lionel ‘YELP’ involuntarily but he
hides it as a sneeze.

Now Randolph is smiling big and we see what a magnetic
presence he can have. An Emperor in a good mood...

                   LIONEL
         What’s your take on it?

                   RANDOLPH
             (beat)
         Easy. I’m a builder.

Lionel looks at the enormous model of the City...

                   LIONEL
         I can see that...

Randolph references Manhattan island...

                   RANDOLPH
         When I was a boy you know how many
         bridges there were on and off
         Manhattan Island? Two. A shitty
         old train trestle here and...
             (he puts a finger on..)
         The Brooklyn Bridge. And when you
         walked across that you were
         stepping in horse dung most of the
         way. You mostly scuttled into New
         York off a dock...like a rat. I
         built that...
             (indicating bridges roads
              and parks)
         and that...and that and that...and
         now you vault over rivers on the
         spans and parkways of Olympus.

                   LIONEL
         They’re nice bridges, I’ll give
         you that.

Randolph turns to him with a smile.

                   RANDOLPH
         Thank you. And I want you to give
         me something else...if you find
         it. Have you found it?

There’s no smile in this. Lionel answers with a question.

                   LIONEL
         What’s in it?

                   RANDOLPH
         Slander. Falsehood. Forgery, most
         likely.

                   LIONEL
         Then you got nothing to worry
         about, the law’s on your side.

                   RANDOLPH
         Very little that I have achieved
         in my life has relied on legality.
         I don’t intend to lean on that
         slender branch now when things
         matter most.

                   LIONEL
         You’re above the law?

                   RANDOLPH
         No, no...I’m ahead of it.

                   LIONEL
         What’s the difference?

Randolph looks at his vision of the City...

                   RANDOLPH
         Law’s just a rule book we make for
         the world we find ourselves in.
         You rebuild a city, you have to
         push ahead into a new world that
         most people can’t even envision
         yet... then the law follows along
         and adapts to what you’ve done.

                   LIONEL
         Who you rebuilding it for?

                   RANDOLPH
             (obviously)
         The future. The people to come.
             (gestures)
         In 50, 100 years, what do you
         think will matter out of what we
         do now? What do you think will
         help people make the world of
         science fiction real? The laws
         from today?! Or roads and bridges
         and tunnels for commerce to move
         swiftly on, parks and beaches to
         let people escape the rat race and
         inspire the mind, palaces of
         culture where hellish slums used
         to be...

                   LIONEL
         Sounds great unless you’re a
         person who’s in the way now.

Randolph laughs and points at the City map...

                   RANDOLPH
         Central Park: Greatest urban park
         in the world. They started
         building it when there wasn’t even
         a city past 57th St. They kicked
         out farmers and tenant squatters,
         sheep herders out of muddy fields
         and filth. They moved some trees.
         And people protested the loss of
         goddam ‘countryside’. But if one
         man hadn’t been able to SEE AHEAD
         to what we’d need, this city’d be
         unlivable today, wouldn’t it? Yes
         it would.

          thank him every day. I do.

          The important thing in life is to
          Get Things Done. Those who can,

          criticize. But I won’t obstruct
          the great work of the world
          because some chipmunks start
          screeching about having to
          relocate their nuts.

Those words are more than Lionel’s head can take..

                    LIONEL
          Screech-a-munk-nut-chip!

His arm SNAPS out twice with this exclamation...

Lieberman pauses mid-smoke...his eyes widening...

Randolph stares at   Lionel, measuring this... He seems to
grasp that this is   an affliction...not an offense. He puts
a hand on Lionel’s   shoulder with fatherly aspect, towering
over him...pulling   him into this vision...

                    RANDOLPH
          Talent and brains get rewarded in

          us on this and I’ll see to it
          personally that your gifts are

          But that’s the offer today. Let us
          know where you stand by tonight.

He turns and walks to the window. Meeting over.


INT BA HEADQUARTERS - WAITING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Lieberman escorts Lionel out to his two ‘body men’ and
nods. They hand him back FRANK’S GUN. As Lionel holsters
it.

Lieberman regards Lionel curiously...

Lionel storms in and DANNY looks up as he goes over to his
desk.

CLOSE ON: his notes, the words “Formosa”, “Signature”, the
newspaper PHOTO of Moses and Paul Randolph, King Rooster

Lionel fixates on it all, muttering to himself, trying to
see what he’s been missing...

          can’t...

He picks up the photos of Laura and Billy, scanning them
each again...there are only 4 or 5...

Danny comes after him but Lionel is back out the door,
almost hitting Danny with it in his charge to the desk...A
SMALL STACK OF PHOTOS IN HIS HAND. He drops them on the
desk and starts to scan them.

toward the club; Billy entering; emerging again...

INT. A TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON

JAZZ on the radio... discordant, harsh...

Lionel sits in the back, head spinning...LOW WINTER SUN
flaring in his eyes...He tips FRANK’S HAT forward to shield
them and leans back...

                    LIONEL
          Frank Frankady Franko! What’s it
          about, Frank?

SOUND goes MUFFLED an EERIE...sounds of music over horns

FLASHBACK TO AN IMAGE: MINNA in the DREAM ON THE BRIDGE,
TAPPING his forehead and mouthing words we can’t hear but
might make out or remember (”kept it under my hat.”) And
this throws Lionel’s mind to...

ANOTHER IMAGE: Lionel’s POV from the car in the first
scene, sound coming in now like a dream...MINNA LEANING IN
THE WINDOW GRINNING

                    MINNA
          I gotta keep this one under my
          hat, boys.

MINNA WINKS and....

LIONEL’S EYES POP OPEN IN THE CAB...

                      LIONEL
          IF!

Not breathing, he tips MINNA’S HAT back and slowly pulls it
off his head...staring at it...

                    LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
          Frankady Frankly Franko Frank...

He puts his fingers inside the HAT’S INNER BAND and slowly
runs them from front to the back where they STOP...FEELING
SOMETHING...AND THEN HE PULLS OUT A FOLDED PIECE OF
PAPER...WRAPPED AROUND...A KEY.

SHAKING, HIS FINGERS START TO UNFOLD THE PAPER...

LIONEL’S FACE AS HE READS IT....

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Take me to Penn Station...


INT. PENN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

The OLD PENN STATION...the now-destroyed masterpiece of
vaulted iron...the grandest terminal ever built...

LIONEL moves through the drifting crowd and beams of low
yellow winter sunset, heading toward...

A bank of LUGGAGE LOCKERS... He searches for a number,
finds it and INSERTS THE KEY... THE DOOR OPENS.

He reaches inside and pulls out...MINNA’S ENVELOPE.

He sits on a bench and opens it

TIGHT ON: The items spilling out...documents and a woman’s
watch.

LIONEL FLIPS THROUGH THEM, STUDYING...

TIGHT ON DETAILS: numerous HOTEL REGISTRY CARDS with the
name “Moses Randolph” on them and his signature; Employment
records for the same hotel for a “Bella Rose”; a fine watch
inscribed “To Bella”; and last...

A BIRTH CERTIFICATE...of LAURA ROSE. 1927.

The mother’s name is listed “Bella Rose” and signed.

The witness is “Billy Rose”, signed.

The father’s name: “Moses Randolph”...and it’s signed.

Lionel flips to the hotel registries. The signature is the
same...

LIONEL’s FACE: registering the impossible.

CU: under all the ‘evidence’, a folded document with note
written on it -- “For Lionel, if you find this... F”

ON LIONEL: as he unfolds it and reads, puzzled at first,
then he reacts, containing emotion

                   LIONEL
             (whispered)
         Ah Frank...Frank Frankady Franko.

He folds that document and puts it in his coat pocket, puts
all the rest back in the envelope, puts it back in the
locker, locks it up, looks around and exits....and we hold
on that door and it’s nondescript number...then turn to see
Lionel blending into the crowd and we...

RISE HIGH OVER THE GRANDEUR OF THE TERMINAL WITH THE SECRET
LOCKED UP IN A SMALL CORNER AND THE WORLD GOING BY. And
then we CUT TO:


EXT. PAUL’S BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR

SOMEONE’s POV: watching Lionel enter Paul’s building...

SOUND OF A BUZZER takes us into...


INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT - SAME

The door has been left open and LIONEL enters to find PAUL
sitting at his humble table by the street windows, still
glowing in the fading light. PAUL looks up.

                   PAUL
         You found it.

                   LIONEL
             (nods)
         There’s only one way I can make
         sense of it.

Paul waits for it...

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         He didn’t sign her birth
         certificate. You did.

He sits. Paul sighs...a secret held for so long...ready to
confess. He puts his face in his hands.

                   PAUL
         Yes.  I signed it.
             (looks up)
         Billy brought her to our family’s
         home. Our servants tried to send
         them away and Billy started
         yelling. We were at dinner with
         our mother, for godsake. I
         followed Mo to the door. He
         scorned them, refused to
         acknowledge, but I saw the truth
         in her face. And his. The way he
         looked at her.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
Even 6 months gone, she was
beautiful. He sent them away with
threats. But I followed them. I
got them to take some
money...later got a doctor.

          LIONEL
You confronted him about it.

          PAUL
I begged him. I invoked every
principle and value we had been
raised to champion. I was...in
anguish. You can’t
understand...Our whole young life,
he was my hero. We wrote our
Creed. We were going to fix the
world together... but to serve
people, you have to love people.
Mo tried but he was so brilliant
that he resented lesser minds and
he became hard. Obsessed with
winning and addicted to power.
Totally contemptuous of...ideals.
    (real hate)
This phony 'man of the people’...
The Jews call a man who's not what
he seems to be an ‘apicoris’.
That's a dangerous thing, when
people aren't seen for what they
really are...a very dangerous
thing.
    (to himself)
...or a sad thing, right?

          LIONEL
Apicorpricot! Apple core it!

         PAUL
Right.

          LIONEL
Nobody else knows who she is?

          PAUL
Not even Horowitz.

         LIONEL
Why?

          PAUL
She’d have used it. And used it to
good effect.

         But it would devastate Laura.
         Totally. Satisfaction won’t
         unburden a tortured heart...so I
         can hold it...and so can
         you...please.

Lionel pulls the key from his pocket and holds it up before
placing it in Paul’s hand.

                   LIONEL
         It's in a Penn Station locker. If
         anything happens to me, mail it to
         Jacob Gleason at the Post.

                   PAUL
         The Post is a rag...

                   LIONEL
         Yeah but the Times is in
         Randolph’s pocket too. I gotta go
         get her out of town until after
         that vote.


EXT. PAUL’S BUILDING/STREET - NIGHT

Lionel exits and turns the corner under the Elevated track

POV: SOMEONE CLOSING ON HIM FAST FROM BEHIND...hand
reaching out to grab him.

LIONEL spins fast...fist up to see:     TONY

                   TONY
         Heya, Lionel.

                   LIONEL
         What are you doing here, Tony?

                   TONY
         Watching your back. Whaddya say we
         get a drink?


INT. BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT

An old school bar. Lionel and Tony sit at a small table.

                   LIONEL
         How long you been following me?

                   TONY
         I wasn’t. They put me on his
         building. I saw you come along.

         ‘They’?

                   TONY
         Let’s don’t bullshit each other,
         you been talking to em too.

                   LIONEL
         Not working for em. Were you
         following me when Billy said he’d
         mail it? You tell em that? They
         killed him and he didn’t even have
         it. But why try to figure any of
         it out? You’re just moving up,
         right?

He’s agitated, twitching. A waitress comes up...

                   TONY
         Seven and Seven. Have a drink,
         Lionel.

                   LIONEL
         Hot water. Tea bag on the side.
         Sugar and Milk on the side. Very
         hot. HOT SUGAR TITS MILKY TEA
         FACE!

The waitress reacts...

                   TONY
         Don’t pay him no mind, doll.
         There’s something wrong with his
         head.

She shrugs...goes off...

                   LIONEL
         There’s nothing wrong with my
         head.

                   TONY
         Coulda fooled me.

         How long you been fucking Julia?
             (no response)

         Everybody's got a find their own
         way in the world, Lionel. You
         think I was going to hang in
         Frank's shadow all my life? Okay
         for you, not for me. Not for her.

The waitress brings the drinks.

                   WAITRESS
         Careful...

She departs again.

                   TONY
             (re: the tea)
         C’mon, let's have a real drink,
         Lionel. What’s the big fuckin’
         deal? We help em get what they
         want and get on a new ride. An
         easier ride for once. After all
         the shit we had to survive just to
         grow up? We’re due an easy gig.
         You especially. C’mon I know you
         got a talent and I'll make sure
         there's a place for you. Be real
         partners.

Lionel pulls the mug over toward him and starts dipping the
tea bag slowly up and down in it.

                   LIONEL
         I’ll think about it after
         tomorrow. I got something I gotta
         go take care--

                   TONY
         Don’t go up to Harlem tonight,

         It’s the last loose end and it’s
         outta my hands anyway. Now let’s
         just have a drink--

AND LIONEL FLINGS THE BOILING WATER RIGHT IN HIS FACE.

TONY SHOUTS, GRABBING HIS FACE AND LIONEL IS EXPLODING OUT
OF THE SEAT AND HEADING FOR THE DOOR BUT TONY LUNGES,
KNOCKING OVER THEIR TABLE, SEIZING HIM IN A WRESTLERS
TACKLE, SPINNING HIM AROUND AND SLAMMING HIM TO THE FLOOR,
CRASHING ON TOP OF HIM AND IMMEDIATELY SEIZING HIS THROAT
IN A MURDEROUS CHOKE

LIONEL TRIES DESPERATELY TO BREAK HIS HANDS AWAY, THEN GOES
FOR THE GUN STRAPPED TO HIM BUT TONY SLAMS HIS KNEE INTO
LIONEL’S CHEST, BLOCKING HIM...LIONEL IS GETTING DESPERATE,

CLOSE ON: HIS HAND SEARCHING FOR ANYTHING, FINDING THE
HEAVY GLASS SUGAR SHAKER ROLLING ON THE GROUND. AND HE
BRINGS THE HEAVY GLASS SHAKER UP AGAINST TONY’S
TEMPLE...HARD...WITH A NASTY CRUNCH.

TONY GOES OVER AND OFF HIM WITH A GRUNT, STUNNED, LIONEL
SCRAMBLES TO HIS KNEES AND HITS HIM AGAIN ABOVE THE EYE.
AND TONY IS OUT FOR THE COUNT.

That’s all the opening Lionel needs. He is up, choking, out
the door and into:


EXT. STREET BY BAR - NIGHT

LIONEL IS SPRINTING, BREATH EXPLODING IN THE COLD AIR.
Turning a corner and stopping at...A PAYPHONE.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

LAURA boards the train. She is fighting back tears.


INT. TAXI CAB - SAME MOMENT

Lionel leans forward to the cabbie...

         149th and St Nicholas. Harlem.
         Floor it, I got money!


INT. SUBWAY CAR/TAXI CAB (INTERCUTTING) - NIGHT

Laura moves from one car to another and a MAN seems to be
following her.

THE CAB, racing uptown, beating a yellow light going red...

IN THE TRAIN: an announcement that the train will go no
further due to a breakdown. Laura groans and prepares to
get out with other passengers

LIONEL coming out of his skin in the back.


EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT

Laura walking in the cold, farther from home than normal


EXT./INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS

Lionel looking out the window: The KING ROOSTER and LAURA’s
BUILDING coming into view

POV: Laura a few steps from her corner

He cranks the window down and SCREAMS HER NAME, but as he
does a LARGE TRUCK passes drowning him out. It clears and
she’s rounding the corner, unaware. He’s not going to catch
her...He hurls money at the cabbie and leaps out
practically still rolling.


EXT. STREET / KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS

He immediately looks up at: LAURA’S APT WINDOW. A light in
the window SUDDENLY GOES OUT. SOMEONE IS WAITING IN HER
APARTMENT and Lionel explodes across the street.

HIGH-TEMPO MUSIC SNAPS IN...COMING FROM THE CLUB.

He hits the sidewalk, past the ROOSTER. The TRUMPET PLAYER
looks up from his cigarette at Lionel flying by.


EXT. LAURA’S APARTMENT BUILDING / SIDE STREET - NIGHT

A car is parked in the shadows across the street.

Over the shoulder of the driver we see LIONEL BURST AROUND
THE CORNER...the DRIVER (LOU) reacts in shock

                    LOU
          Son of a bitch!

He piles out of the car, moving into the street as Lionel
enters the vestibule and desperately HITS EVERY BUZZER.

Someone buzzes him in and as he pushes frantically in and
closes the door, he sees something in the reflection and
looks back to see

LOU: EMERGING FROM SHADOW INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

They lock eyes for a split second before Lionel SLAMS THE
DOOR and sprints for the stairs.


INT. STAIRWELL OF LAURA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Lionel taking the stairs three at a time, not daring to
yell to her but PULLING FRANK’s GUN AS HE RUNS.


INT. LAURA’S HALLWAY/APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

ON LAURA: reaching her landing and moving to her apartment
at the end of the hall to put her key in the lock when the
sound of feet coming fast makes her pause and turn...

...AND THERE IS LIONEL ALMOST ON HER, EYES WIDE, GUN OUT

She OPENS HER MOUTH TO EXCLAIM...BUT HE’S ON HER, CLAMPING
HIS HAND OVER HER MOUTH AND SILENCING HER WITH A GESTURE.
HE LOOKS TOWARD HER DOOR...HER EYES GO THERE, NOW
TERRIFIED...

...Her hand is still on the key in the lock...gently he
puts his hand over hers and carefully, eases her shaking
hand off the key

THE DOOR JERKS OPEN and THE GIANT LOOMS OVER THEM.

LAURA SCREAMS and LIONEL SHOVES HER BACK AND DUCKS, BARELY
EVADING THE SWIPE OF A KNIFE THAT SPEARS MINNA’S HAT OFF
HIS HEAD AND STICKS INTO THE WOODEN DOOR FRAME

LIONEL TRIES TO RAISE FRANK’S .45 BUT THE GIANT’S HUGE HAND
TOMAHAWKS DOWN, HITTING LIONEL’S GUN HAND

BOOM! THE .45 FIRES STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GIANT’S RIGHT
FOOT. HE GRUNTS AND DROPS, SMASHING THE GUN OUT OF LIONEL’S
HAND AND TO THE FLOOR AND KNOCKING LIONEL DOWN TOO.

POINT BLANK AT LIONEL. LIONEL FLINCHES AND LAURA SCREAMS AS

CLICK. THE GUN JAMS. LIONEL IS UP AND MOVING AS THE GIANT
TRIES TO WORK THE SLIDE AND FIRE. CLICK. LAURA IS HEADING
FOR THE STAIRS BUT LIONEL GRABS HER AND SHOVES HER TOWARD
THE END OF THE HALL AS THE GIANT TRIES AGAIN. CLICK.

THE GIANT TOSSES THE JAMMED GUN ASIDE AND RISES PAINFULLY,
HIS FOOT BLEEDING HEAVILY. HE YANKS HIS KNIFE FROM THE
DOORFRAME AND STARTS TO LIMP TOWARD THEM

LIONEL IS HURLING OPEN THE WINDOW AT THE END OF THE HALL

Laura scrambles out the window onto the fire escape with
Lionel right behind her...ONE LAST LOOK AT the GIANT
STRIDING TOWARD THEM FASTER.


EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

HOT, FAST MUSIC coming from THE ROOSTER nearby...They are 4
STORIES UP on a 5 story building and the FIRE ESCAPE is old
and rickety...

Laura goes left fast, putting her hand on the railing only
to have it BREAK COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE BRICK WALL,
ALMOST SENDING HER INTO SPACE. SHE SCREAMS AS LIONEL GRABS
HER ARM AND PRACTICALLY THROWS HER UP THE LADDER. JUST AS
HE STARTS TO CLIMB BEHIND HER--

SMASH! THE WHOLE WINDOW FRAME EXPLODES IN GLASS AND
SPLINTERS AS THE GIANT COMES STRAIGHT THROUGH IT LIKE IT
WAS PAPER...

LAURA’S SCREAM CUTS THROUGH THE DARK...and the MUSIC JAM
STOPS SUDDENLY.

Lionel desperately climbs but he’s running into Laura and
then A HUGE HAND HAS HIM BY THE ANKLE...HE GRABS THE
RAILINGS AND HAULS HIS WHOLE BODY UP AGAINST THE IMMOVABLE
WEIGHT...it’s just enough to stretch the Giant’s arm enough
that he can’t swing his KNIFE HAND up as high...

LIONEL’s ELBOWS are locked around posts of the railing,
trying to resist...being pulled down...but it’s too much
and HE’S SLIPPING...he DROPS TWO STEPS FAST, CLAWING TO GET
A NEW GRIP...but the KNIFE IS MOVING IN when...

CRASH! Something HITS the Giant RIGHT IN THE FOREHEAD,
OPENING A CUT LIKE A BOXER, AS LIONEL TWISTS AWAY...

THE GIANT looks up at...LAURA ON THE PLATFORM ABOVE,
HOLDING A SECOND FLOWER POT WHICH SHE THROWS DOWN HARD.

THE GIANT THROWS UP HIS KNIFE HAND TO BLOCK IT BUT THE
IMPACT KNOCKS THE KNIFE OUT OF HIS HAND AND AS HIS MOVEMENT
STANDS HIM UP A LITTLE TOO STRAIGHT ON THE LADDER...

LIONEL PUTS A FOOT AGAINST THE MAN’S CHEST AND KICKS HARD.

THE GIANT LURCHES BACK...ARMS PINWHEELING, TIPPING BACK AND
CRASHING INTO THE BROKEN RAILING WHICH FLIES OFF THE WALL,
PITCHING HIM OUT INTO OPEN SPACE. BUT HIS FLAILING HAND
MANAGES TO GRAB THE SILL OF A WINDOW.

LAURA: RUNS ACROSS THE PLATFORM ABOVE LIONEL TO THE FAR
RAIL AND LOOKS DOWN. FOR A FROZEN SECOND SHE AND THE GIANT
LOOK RIGHT AT EACH OTHER...AND THEN HE SILENTLY FALLS, a
horrible drop...CRASHING ON HIS BACK ONTO A LOW DIVIDING
WALL IN THE ALLEY WITH A SICKENING CRACK.

LIONEL appears next to her. He looks down at the broken
body, unmoving. Laura is SHAKING HARD. He grabs her
shoulders and finds her eyes.

                   LIONEL
         There’s another one downstairs.
         Come on...

And he starts up the final ladder to the roof...


EXT. LAURA’S BUILDING - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

LIONEL bursts onto the roof and shouts into the dark...

                   LIONEL
         She doesn’t know! SHE DOESN’T
         KNOW!

Voices of concern shouting from other apartments can be
heard as Lionel turns back to help a shaking Laura onto the
roof.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         It’s okay...we’re okay. But we
         gotta move.

She nods and they start toward the ROOFTOP DOOR to a
STAIRWELL...they are half way across when OUT OF THE SHADOW
STEPS...

LOU...cold and precise, he LIFTS A SILENCED REVOLVER.

Lionel steps in front of Laura...

He pulls the hammer back and levels it...

LIONEL: something behind Lou catching his eye...

CLANG! LOU DROPS LIKE A LOG, revealing...

THE TRUMPETER...WIELDING HIS HORN LIKE AN BASEBALL
BAT...THE INSTRUMENT BADLY BENT from the impact with Lou’s
head...

The SAX PLAYER and BILLY’S FRIEND from the club step out
behind him.

LAURA is on a sofa, staring into nothing...The MUSICIANS

Lionel is on a phone...

                   LIONEL
         I want to see him alone. Yeah,
         right now.
             (writes something down)
         Try anything funny and tomorrow
         will be the worst day you’ve had
         in a long time.

He hangs up...looks at Laura. She looks shell-shocked.

He looks at THE TRUMPETER who nods at him. Under control.
LIONEL takes THE FOLDED DOCUMENT that MINNA LEFT HIM WITH
THE FILE out of his coat pocket...shows the TRUMPETER
something on it.

                   LIONEL (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         You know where this is? Can you
         take her there?

                   TRUMPET
         I always like a night drive.

                   LIONEL
             (to Laura)
         Go with them. You’ll be safe at
         this place tonight.

                   LAURA
         What don’t I know?

He stops and looks at her.

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         It wasn’t the story she wanted to
         hear. And no good would come from
         telling it, so I wanted to say ‘It
         doesn’t matter. It’s got nothing to
         do with you.’ But there’s no upside
         in lying to a woman who’s smarter
         than you, so I told her the
         truth...

We see him telling her the dark truth and her head drops
and we CUT TO:


INT. PUBLIC ATHLETIC CLUB - POOL - NIGHT

We’ve been here before...the HUGE PRIVATE POOL with its
canopy of glass...but now more dimly lit inside and steamy

                   LIONEL (V.O.)
         Frank told me once if you’re up
         against someone bigger than you,
         someone you can’t beat toe to toe:
         make em think you respect their
         size and cut a deal that lets you
         walk out in one piece. Then figure
         out a way to stick it to em later
         without leaving your prints on the
         knife. Even walking in there I
         wasn’t sure exactly how to play
         it. I just hoped in all the steam
         he wouldn’t see me sweating.

Lionel is admitted through a door He moves to a bench and
sits to wait as A FIGURE SWIMS IN THE DARK, churning the
water with powerful strokes.

MOSES RANDOLPH: swimming powerfully from the far end toward
him. He exits the pool, puts on a robe and stands over
Lionel, IMPOSING and FIERCE. LIONEL is ticcing badly...not
able to control his nerves. He YELPS TWICE...almost a
BARK...then..

                   LIONEL
         Who’s the fucking Boss now,
         Bailey! Who’s the boss!

RANDOLPH regards him cooly...interested.

                   RANDOLPH
         So what is it with you?

                   LIONEL
         I got somethin’ wrong with my
         head. Didn’t your goons fill you
         in yet?

                   RANDOLPH
         I don’t care about your fucking
         affliction. I mean what's your
         angle in this? What do you want
         for that file?

                   LIONEL
         I want to hear your version of it.

                   RANDOLPH
         Why?

                   LIONEL
         Let’s just say an unfinished
         puzzle makes my head hurt, more’n
         most people.

Randolph turns this over...assessing it.

                   RANDOLPH
         I smooth it all out for your pain
         in the ass brain...we putting this
         to bed tonight?

                   LIONEL
         It’s you best shot.

Randolph SITS DOWN NEXT TO HIM

                   RANDOLPH (cont’d)
         I was young. I was the Get Things
         Done man for the greatest governor
         in the history of this state.
             (remembering)
         We had a party, it was the good
         years, before the Crash. The
         Tammany parties were like nothing
         before or since. We had a whole
         fucking hotel. I saw her there,
         working.

          RANDOLPH (cont’d)
She was...I’d never felt...lust...
like that. Like a fist in my
crotch. You know 25 years later
when I think of her it still makes
my blood move.
    (beat)
I followed her into a service
hall, she knew I had. She looked
back at me and then went into a
supply room.
    (beat)
I went in there and I took her
against the spare towels.

          LIONEL
You raped her?

          RANDOLPH
I moved on her that first time.
But I treated her well...gave her
things. I saw to it that the Party
used that hotel a lot for a few
years.
    (beat)
She could have disappeared any
time. Stopped working there. But
she didn’t. She was shy but she
knew how things worked and she was
always grateful.
    (scoffs)
Rape. Do you have the first
inkling of what power is? Power
is feeling...knowing...that you
can do anything you want to and
there's not a fucking person who
can stop you. And if somebody else
has a dumb idea that you don't
like, that's the end of that idea,
or the end of that person if you
want.
    (low, dangerous)
And if I can build highways when
the rest of the country is broke,
I’ll punch through any
neighborhood I damn well want to.
And if some Negro slum is where I
want to put my Federal project, or
an off ramp for my bridge then all
the goodie goodies in the world
can shriek and moan as loud as
they want. And if some chump
thinks he can blackjack me by
threatening to move our baseball
team?

                   RANDOLPH (CONT'D)
         Then buddy the Dodgers can take it
         on the arches to the fucking coast
         and I'll get a new team that plays
         ball with ME, in MY stadium.
             (turns to Lionel)
         And if I want to fuck a colored
         girl in a hotel room now and then
         because I'm feeling like a
         wrecking ball then, pal, I'm gonna
         do it. And if you think I'm gonna
         let some little chip who never
         should have been born, or your
         small time boss or my brother and
         his ideals and his forgeries in my
         name slow down what I'm GETTING
         DONE in this city, you gotta lot
         to learn about how power works.
         Cause all those people are
         invisible...they don't even exist.

                   LIONEL
         See if you feel that way tomorrow
         when they blow up your big vote.

                     RANDOLPH
         She know?

Lionel’s look says no. Randolph calculates...

                   RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Interesting. So it's you and Paul.
         I know what he wants. If he had
         any balls he'd have used this
         before to box me in and take it
         from me. I’d have respected that
         actually, but he thinks the way
         you do things matters. It's why
         he’ll never be anybody. You an
         idealist too? You gonna trade me
         that file to save the block you
         grew up on? Make me draw my lines
         somewhere else for some committee
         of childless women, howling about
         their negro adoptees? Or you just
         another blackmailing gumshoe who
         wants to transact with me? Name
         it!

                   LIONEL
         Name it! CLAIM it! Shame it!
             (beat - calms)
         That blackmailing gumshoe was my
         friend and that girl is the only
         reason you’re still breathing.

         Do what you want to the city.
         Build your pyramids on the Nile.
         But you leave her alone. Anything
         happens to her, it gets mailed.

Randolph narrows his eyes...reading into this,
countering...

                   RANDOLPH
         Make no mistake, you or Paul
         messes with what I intend to get
         done and I'll make her life even
         worse than I made his. You tell
         him I said that.

                   LIONEL
         I guess we’ve got a deal. So I’ll
         give you one for free.
             (turns)
         You man Lieberman is gonna cause
         you problems.

                   RANDOLPH
         How so?

                   LIONEL
         He owns a piece of half the
         companies doing contracts with
         slum clearance. And I’m guessing
         he hasn’t told you about that. So
         when you ‘handle’ him...tell him
         it was me that told you and that
         that’s for Frank.

                   RANDOLPH
             (actually surprised)
         Son of a bitch. You come off
         weird, but you’re smart. You
         should’ve taken my offer. You
         could’ve made em all get on their
         knees and apologize.
             (beat)
         Although if she’s anything like
         her mother, I can understand the
         pull.

On that Lionel stands and turns to go. Randolph looks up

                   RANDOLPH (cont’d) (CONT’D)
         Oh, and tell my brother... I read
         his masterwork. It’s as brilliant
         as everyone says.

          Nobody else could have done it and
          it’s good for absolutely everyone,
          including me. There’s not one
          reason to deny it. Tell him I’ll
          send him my thoughts in the
          morning.

Lionel nods, and walks away into the steam. Randolph looks
down on the bench to see: Lionel has left MINNA’S HAT
BEHIND. He stares off...

                    RANDOLPH (CONT’D)
          SON OF A BITCH!

The echoes and we CUT TO:


EXT. DAWN ON THE CITY / LIONEL DRIVING - MONTAGE

Images of the city interspersed with Lionel driving,
getting somewhere beyond it all. Long Island.


EXT. PAUL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Paul can be seen in the entryway, pulling his mail out of
the box with some urgency...expectant. He sifts it, his
focus is on one envelope that has arrived.

He comes out into the cold stares at the envelope a beat
then looks up into the morning sun, takes a breath and
opens it...reads the letter...

CU: Personal stationary with ‘MR’ at the top and one large
hand-written word: ‘DENIED.’

WIDE ON: Paul’s sad figure, shoulders sagging

The letter falls out of his hand and blows away in the cold
wind.

As he turns and shambles away down the street, disappearing
into shadow...

We are back with LIONEL IN THE CAR, CROSSING BRIDGES, FAR OUT
OF THE CITY NOW

                    LIONEL (V.O.)
          Growing up, I always thought Frank
          was a hero but he was no crusader
          in the end. He was just a gumshoe
          trying to make a buck like everyone
          else. But he didn’t have to go to
          that war.

                    LIONEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He was old enough to have skipped
          it and he went anyway because he
          actually thought this country was
          worth fighting for. I never had
          anything I cared about enough to
          look past my own problems. But
          Laura did. There was a story she
          wanted told and I figured it was
          time to get off my ass and pick a
          side.


INT. NY POST NEWSROOM - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

JAKE GLEASON, the Reporter, sits at his desk with his feet up
reviewing his notes. A NEWSBOY blows past the desk dropping
an envelope on it

                    NEWSBOY
          Gleason...for you

GLEASON sits forward and picks it up, eyes scanning

AUDIO FLASHBACK: we hear Lionel and Gleason from when they
first met...LIONEL: “Hey pal, what’s the story here?”
GLEASON: “Stories of injustice and despair...the American
Way.”

And we see, CU: on the envelope is written

“STORIES OF INJUSTICE AND DESPAIR” OR...A BETTER STORY FOR A
REAL REPORTER. LET’S MAKE THINGS INTERESTING....A FRIEND”

GLEASON’S brow furrows, remembering...curious. He opens the
envelope and reacts at

LIONEL HAS RETURNED HIS PRESS CARD, CLIPPED TO A NOTE

“THANKS FOR THE LOAN. PAY YOU BACK WITH A PULITZER”

Now GLEASON is really intrigued and, as the music rises, he
looks at the document and we see that LIONEL HAS STOLEN THE
DOCUMENTS FROM THE HALL OF RECORDS THAT SHOW THAT EXPOSE
LIEBERMAN AND THE BA OFFICERS...LIEBERMAN’S NAME IS CIRCLED

ON GLEASON’S FACE, as his jaw drops in shock. As what he’s
got washes over him, a smile breaks across his face and he
starts laughing with delight and we CUT TO:


EXT. A BEACH HOUSE - MORNING

Lionel’s car pulls up on the edge of a sand-swept road and
he gets out and sees.

LAURA sitting wrapped in blankets on the porch of a
weathered little house.

He stops at the bottom step and stands facing her.

                   LIONEL
         You crazy? It’s freezing out.

He sits next to her...She is shaken. A tear falls on her
face.

                   LAURA
         What is this place?

                   LIONEL
         It was Frank’s.
             (beat)
         Looks like it’s mine now.

She reacts. He pulls out the document Frank left him, which
we realize now must be a will or a title deed. She looks at
it, then up at him tenderly

                    LAURA
         Still looking out for you after
         all.
              (beat)
         Funny how things turn out.

He nods and stares outward at something...puzzling at a
memory.

                   LIONEL
         “Brooklyn’s big, but there’s
         things even bigger.”

                   LAURA
         What’s that?

                   LIONEL
         I think it’s something Frank said
         to me but I can’t remember when.

                   LAURA
         Maybe this is what he meant.

AND WE CUT BEHIND THEM and see the enormous COLD, BLUE
OCEAN, WAVES POUNDING ONTO MILES OF FROZEN EMPTY WHITE
SAND.
